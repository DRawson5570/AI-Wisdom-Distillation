Problem: [9-12], [14-15], [12-13], [14-17] | 3 rooms (max_simultaneous=2)
Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 5.6s

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Meetings and Overlaps**:
   - Meeting 1: [9-12] overlaps with Meeting 3: [12-13]
   - Meeting 2: [14-15] overlaps with Meeting 4: [14-17]
   - Meetings 1, 2 do not overlap with each other
   - Meetings 3, 4 start at the same time but do not conflict as per the problem structure

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 12, both Meeting 1 and Meeting 3 are happening simultaneously (2 meetings)
   - At time 14, both Meeting 2 and Meeting 4 are happening simultaneously (2 meetings)

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.
   - There are 3 available rooms.

While the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, which is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (3), this analysis overlooks a critical point: it's possible that more than two meetings could occur simultaneously if we consider overlapping periods. 

Upon closer inspection:
- Meetings [9-12] and [14-15] can be scheduled without conflict.
- However, Meeting [12-13] and Meeting [14-17] cannot both start at the same time as they overlap with different meetings.

Thus, despite having 3 rooms available, it is impossible to schedule all these meetings simultaneously due to overlapping time periods. Therefore, the answer remains **NO**.

Current Strategy Being Used:
To determine if meetings can be scheduled:
1. Check which meetings overlap in time
2. Count the maximum number of meetings happening at the same time
3. If max_simultaneous <= num_rooms: YES (solvable)

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 4.0s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Meetings that Overlap**:
   - Meetings [14-15] and [14-15] both overlap, meaning they are the same meeting.
   - Meeting [14-15] also overlaps with [15-18] because part of the time range [15-18] starts in the middle of [14-15].
   - Meeting [9-12] does not overlap directly with any other meetings, but it is concurrent with parts of the overlapping intervals.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At 14:00 to 15:00, you have at least three meetings happening simultaneously: two instances of [14-15] and [15-18].
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - You only have 3 available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) equals the number of available rooms, it might seem initially that all meetings could be scheduled. However, you must consider the overlap more closely:

- Both instances of [14-15] are effectively one meeting during the entire time range.
- Therefore, at 14:00 to 15:00, you need three rooms for two simultaneous [14-15] meetings and [15-18].

This means you actually have a conflict because all three rooms would be needed at that specific time, which is more than the available number of rooms.

Thus, the answer is **NO**.

Time: 2.4s

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meeting [11-12] and any other meeting do not overlap.
   - Meetings [13-15], [13-14], and [14-15] all overlap with each other because their time ranges partially or completely coincide.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At the overlapping times between 13:00 to 15:00, we have four meetings happening simultaneously: [13-15], [13-14], [14-15].
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 4.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - Since there are only 3 rooms available and a maximum of 4 meetings need to happen simultaneously, it is impossible to schedule all these meetings without conflicts.
   
Thus, NO, not all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts given the available rooms.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 4.0s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - [9-12] and [10-12] overlap from 10:00 to 12:00.
   - [14-15] does not overlap with any other meeting as there is a gap between the end of [13] (if we assume no meetings at 13) and its start.
   - [11-13] overlaps with [9-12] from 11:00 to 12:00, but not after that.
   - [15-18] starts after all other meetings end.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 10:00, both [9-12] and [10-12] are happening simultaneously (2 meetings).
   - No other time has more than 2 simultaneous meetings.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, which is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (3), it might seem solvable at first glance.
   - However, we need to consider that all three rooms are occupied from 10:00 to 12:00 by [9-12] and [10-12]. This means only one additional meeting can be scheduled during this time.

Given the constraints, since two meetings overlap for a significant portion of their duration (from 10:00 to 12:00), it's impossible to schedule all these meetings without conflicts if only three rooms are available. Therefore, the answer is NO.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 3.7s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meeting [9-11] overlaps with [10-12].
   - Meeting [13-15] overlaps with both [13-14] and [13-15].

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   At time 13, there are two meetings happening simultaneously: [13-15] and [13-14]. Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - Since we have 2 rooms but need at least 2 meetings to occur simultaneously (as calculated), this condition is met.
   
However, when we look at the entire schedule, we see that there are more than one meeting happening at a time point where only two rooms are available. Specifically, at time 13 and onwards:
   - Meeting [9-11] ends at 11, so from 11 to 12, it is no longer active.
   - At 12, both meetings [10-12] and [13-15] are still ongoing until 14.

Therefore, during the time period between 13 and 14 (inclusive), three meetings need to be scheduled:
   - Meeting [13-15]
   - Meeting [13-14]
   - Meeting [10-12]

Since there are only 2 rooms available, it is not possible to accommodate all these meetings without conflicts.

Thus, the answer is NO.

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - [9-10]: Overlaps with both [9-10] and [9-12].
   - [9-12]: Overlaps with [9-10] and [10-12].
   - [10-12]: Overlaps with [9-10] and [9-12].
   - [13-14]: No overlap.
   - [15-16]: No overlap.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   At time 10, the following meetings are happening simultaneously: [9-10], [10-12]. Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) is equal to the number of available rooms, it seems initially feasible. However, we must ensure that no more than 3 meetings are happening at any given time throughout the entire schedule.

Let's examine the full timeline:
- [9:00 - 12:00]: Meetings [9-10] and [9-12]
- [10:00 - 12:00]: Meeting [10-12] starts, ending meeting [9-10]. Now we have meetings [10-12], [9-12].
- [13:00 - 14:00]: Meetings [13-14]
- [15:00 - 16:00]: Meeting [15-16]

At time 10, we have 3 meetings happening simultaneously (9-10, 10-12, and the start of 9-12), which matches the available rooms. However, at 11:00, meeting [9-12] ends but both [10-12] and [15-16] are ongoing, causing another simultaneous presence of 3 meetings.

Thus, with 3 rooms, it is possible to schedule these meetings without conflicts. Therefore, the answer should be **YES**.

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Check**: The two meetings are [9-12] and [11-12]. Meeting [9-12] starts at 9 and ends at 12, while meeting [11-12] starts at 11 and ends at 12. These meetings overlap from 11 to 12.
   
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**: At time 11 and 12, both meetings are happening simultaneously. Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**: There are 2 available rooms, which matches exactly with the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2).

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) does not exceed the number of available rooms (2), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Time: 4.3s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Meetings and Overlaps**:
   - [12-15] overlaps with [12-13] (both from 12:00 to 15:00).
   - [12-15] also overlaps with [11-14] (from 12:00 to 14:00).
   - [12-15] and [15-18] do not overlap as the latter starts after the former ends.
   - [12-13] does not overlap with [11-14] since it is completely contained within that meeting.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   At 12:00, three meetings are happening simultaneously: [12-15], [12-13], and [11-14].

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Maximum simultaneous meetings = 3
   - Number of available rooms = 3

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) is equal to the number of available rooms, it seems possible at first glance. However, we need to consider the exact time ranges more carefully:

- From 12:00 to 13:00, [12-15] and [12-13] are happening.
- From 13:00 to 14:00, only [12-15] is happening.
- From 14:00 onwards, multiple meetings can start but we have already maxed out the rooms at 12:00.

Given that there are three simultaneous meetings starting at 12:00 and no additional room to accommodate all of them, the solution is not feasible with only 3 available rooms. Therefore, the answer is NO.

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Analysis**: 
   - Meeting [12-13] overlaps with [10-13]
   - Meeting [15-18] overlaps with both [14-15] and [15-18]

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 13, meetings [12-13] and [10-13] are happening simultaneously.
   - At time 15, meetings [15-18], [14-15], and [15-18] are happening simultaneously. This is the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, which is 3.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Maximum simultaneous meetings: 3
   - Available rooms: 3

While the maximum number of simultaneous meetings equals the available number of rooms, we need to ensure that the schedule can be distributed without conflicts over time. In this case:

- At time 13, two meetings [12-13] and [10-13] are happening.
- At time 15, three meetings [15-18], [14-15], and [15-18] would be scheduled, but only two rooms are available.

Thus, it is impossible to schedule all meetings without conflicts given the available rooms.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 5.8s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meeting [9-12] overlaps with [9-11].
   - Meeting [9-11] is completely within the range of [9-12].
   - Meeting [14-17] does not overlap with any other meeting.
   - Meeting [15-17] overlaps with [14-17].

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   At time 11, we have two meetings happening simultaneously: [9-11] and [14-17]. However, since the insight tells us that a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with a meeting starting at time T, this means there is no real conflict between these overlapping periods.

   By examining all possible time points:
   - At 9:00 to 12:00: [9-12] and [9-11] (2 meetings)
   - At 14:00 to 17:00: [14-17] and [15-17] (2 meetings)

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, which is less than the 3 available rooms.

However, we need to consider all possible schedules and ensure that no time slot has more overlapping meetings than available rooms can handle. In this case, even though the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is within the limit of available rooms (3), there's a critical point at 15:00 when [9-11] ends and [15-17] starts without conflict but also with one meeting ending and another starting simultaneously at 15:00, making it still two meetings happening.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 (which would happen from 14:00 to 17:00), and we have 3 rooms available, this does not violate our rule. However, due to the overlapping nature at certain points in time, we cannot guarantee a perfect schedule that fits all without conflicts.

Given the insights provided, we can fit all meetings into three rooms without any direct conflict (overlap at end/start times is permissible), so technically it's possible with proper scheduling. But since the problem statement asks for a straightforward check and our current strategy indicates a need to ensure no more than 3 simultaneous meetings, which are indeed within the available room count, we can conclude:

**YES**

All meetings can be scheduled without conflicts under this simplified strategy.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 4.3s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meeting [11-12] and [12-13] overlap.
   - Meeting [15-16] and [15-17] overlap.
   - No meeting conflicts with another starting or ending at the same time, as per the problem structure.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   At time 12:00, both meetings [11-12] and [12-13] are happening simultaneously (overlap).
   At time 15:00, both meetings [15-16] and [15-17] are happening simultaneously.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.
   - Available rooms: 3.

While the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) does not exceed the number of available rooms (3), we must consider if all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the given strategy. Since [11-12] and [12-13] overlap, they cannot occur at the same time, and similarly for [15-16] and [15-17]. However, scheduling these overlapping meetings requires at least 2 rooms simultaneously, which is feasible with 3 rooms available. 

But to fully schedule all given meetings, we need to check if a room can be allocated without conflicts throughout the entire timeline:
   - Room 1: [11-12], [15-16]
   - Room 2: [12-13], [15-17]

This allocation shows that there are no conflicting overlaps, and thus all meetings can indeed be scheduled with 3 rooms available.

Therefore, the answer is **YES**. All meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the given strategy.

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meetings [11-12], [11-12], and [11-12] all overlap.
   - Meeting [11-14] overlaps with [11-12].
   - Meetings [15-18] and [12-13] do not overlap with any others at their respective times.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 11, there are four overlapping meetings: [11-12], [11-12], [11-12], and [11-14].
   - No other time slot has more than four overlapping meetings.
   
3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 4, but we only have 3 available rooms.
   - Since the maximum simultaneous meetings (4) exceed the number of available rooms (3), it is impossible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Thus, the answer is NO.

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - [11-12] and [11-12]: Overlap.
   - [11-12] and [14-16]: No overlap (end before the start of the next).
   - [11-13] and [14-16]: No overlap (start after the end of the previous meeting).
   - [12-15] and [14-16]: Overlap from 14 to 15.
   - [12-15] and [15-18]: Overlap from 15 to 15 (end at the same time, no conflict).
   
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 11: Meetings [11-12] (3 times), [14-16], and [11-13] overlap, making a total of 3 simultaneous meetings.
   - At time 12: Meetings [11-12], [12-15], and [11-13] overlap, also totaling 3 simultaneous meetings.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3, which matches the number of available rooms.
   
However, it's important to note that even though the max simultaneous meetings equal the number of available rooms, we must ensure that there are no overlaps at all times when scheduling. In this case, while the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) does not exceed the number of rooms (3), overlapping meetings need to be properly scheduled to avoid conflicts.

Given the overlapping nature:
- [11-12], [14-16], and [11-13] overlap at 11, which uses up all three rooms.
- At 12, we still have [11-12], [12-15], and [11-13] overlapping, again using all three rooms.

Since it's impossible to schedule the meetings without overlaps that exceed the number of available rooms at certain times, the answer is **NO**.

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Check**: The two meetings are [11-12] and [10-11]. These do not overlap as one ends at 11 (T) while the other starts at 10 (T), meaning they can coexist in time without conflict.
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**: At any given time, only 1 meeting is occurring since there are no overlapping times between [10-11] and [11-12]. Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 1.
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**: With 3 available rooms and a maximum of only 1 meeting happening simultaneously, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, YES, all meetings can be scheduled given the available rooms.

   - Meeting [14-16] overlaps with both [14-15] and [15-16].
   - Meeting [14-15] only overlaps with [14-16].
   - Meeting [12-15] does not overlap with any other meetings.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 14, three meetings are happening: [12-15], [14-15], and [14-16]. 
   - No single time point has more than three meetings overlapping.
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Analysis**: 
   - Meetings [13-14] and [13-15] overlap.
   - Meeting [13-15] and [14-17] also overlap, but only partially (from 14 to 15).
   - The meeting [12-15] overlaps with both [13-15] from 13 to 15.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 13:00, meetings [13-14], [13-15], and [12-15] are happening simultaneously (3 meetings).
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - With only 2 rooms available, but at least 3 meetings are happening simultaneously from 13:00 to 13:15.
   - Therefore, the maximum simultaneous meetings exceed the number of available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) is greater than the number of available rooms (2), it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Check**: 
   - Meeting [11-14] starts at 11 and ends at 14.
   - Meeting [12-13] starts at 12 and ends at 13.
   
   These two meetings overlap because they share the time period from 12 to 13.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At any given time, we can have a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings (the overlapping part is from 12 to 13, and both meetings are present during this interval).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 2 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need to be scheduled at any point in time is also 2.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) does not exceed the number of available rooms (2), all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

AI Response:

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meeting [10-12] overlaps with both [12-14] and [13-14].
   - Meetings [12-14] and [13-14] do not overlap since a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with a meeting starting at time T.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: 
   - At time 12, there are two meetings happening: [10-12] is ending, but it doesn't conflict with the start of another meeting; thus, we count the other ongoing meeting [12-14]. Additionally, a new meeting starts at 13, making it three simultaneous meetings.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**: 
   - There are 3 available rooms, and the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - However, since all three simultaneous meetings happen at time 12-14, we need exactly 3 rooms for these overlapping periods.
   
Thus, with only 3 available rooms, it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts. The answer is **YES**.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:

   - Meeting [15-16] overlaps with [13-16] and [13-14].
   - Meeting [13-14] overlaps with [13-16], [13-15], and [15-16].

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   At time 15, the following meetings are happening simultaneously: [13-15], [15-16], and [13-14]. Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   There are 3 available rooms, but the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) equals the number of available rooms. However, since all three meetings happening at time 15 cannot be scheduled due to their overlapping times, it means that more than one room is needed for each of these meetings.

Since we have more than one meeting happening simultaneously and the number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the number of available rooms (3), it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts. Thus, the answer is NO.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 4.7s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - [9-10] and [13-15] do not overlap.
   - [15-17] overlaps with [15-18].
   - [13-15] starts after [15-17] ends, so they don't overlap.
   
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 15: Meetings [15-17], [15-18] are happening simultaneously (2 meetings).
   
3. **Comparison to available rooms**: 
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, which is less than the number of available rooms (3).

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) does not exceed the number of available rooms (3), it seems we should be able to schedule all meetings without conflicts. However, upon closer inspection:

- At time 15: Meetings [15-17] and [15-18] are happening.
- At time 16: Meeting [15-18] is still happening (no new meeting starts).
- At time 17: Meeting [15-17] ends, but no new meeting can start exactly at this moment.

The issue arises because even though we have 3 rooms and only 2 meetings are happening simultaneously most of the time, during the period when both [15-17] and [15-18] are occurring, there is a conflict. Since having one room free would allow us to fit all meetings, but not having that spare room means we cannot schedule [15-18] without overlapping with another meeting.

Therefore, despite the maximum simultaneous meetings being 2 (which fits within the number of rooms), the specific timing of meetings [15-17] and [15-18] creates a conflict that can't be resolved with just 3 rooms. 

Thus, **NO**, not all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts given only 3 available rooms.

AI Response:

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: The meetings [10-12], [10-11], and [9-10] all overlap with each other during the time slots 10-11.
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: During the time slot 10-11, there are three overlapping meetings: [10-11], [10-11], and [10-12]. Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
3. **Comparison to available rooms**: We have only 3 available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) is equal to the number of available rooms, we can schedule all these meetings without conflicts based on the given strategy. However, upon re-evaluating the problem, it seems there was a misunderstanding: since the meetings [10-11] occur twice and do not conflict with themselves at time T, they should be counted as only one meeting for scheduling purposes.

Revised explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: The meetings [10-12], [10-11], and [9-10] all overlap during the time slot 10-11.
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: During the time slot 10-11, there are two distinct meetings: [10-11] (counted once) and [10-12]. So, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is actually 2 (considering one instance of [10-11]).
3. **Comparison to available rooms**: We have 3 available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (3), it is possible to schedule all these meetings without conflicts.

Answer: YES.

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meeting [9-11] overlaps with no other meeting.
   - Meeting [12-13] does not overlap with any other meeting as it starts after the end of [9-11].
   - Meeting [14-16] also does not overlap with any other meeting as it starts after the end of [12-13].

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 11, there are two meetings: [9-11] and [12-13].
   - At time 14, there is one meeting: [14-16].
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) equals the number of available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.
   
However, based on the current strategy provided and focusing strictly on the scenario where we need to ensure that at no point do more meetings start than there are rooms available simultaneously:

- At time 11, two meetings [9-11] and [12-13] end but only one meeting starts (none). 
- At time 14, the meeting [14-16] starts while another ends. This is where we have exactly 2 simultaneous meetings.

Thus, the strategy correctly identifies that with two rooms available, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts, and the answer is **YES**.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   At time 10, the following meetings are happening simultaneously: [9-11], [10-12], and [10-13]. This gives us a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   We have 3 rooms available, but we have determined that up to 3 meetings can happen simultaneously at the same time (time 10). Since the number of simultaneous meetings equals the number of available rooms, this strategy would work if we had more than 3 rooms.

Given only 3 rooms are available and we have a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings, the answer is NO, as the problem requires exactly matching resources to handle the peak load without conflicts.

Expected: NO | Got: YES | ✗
Time: 3.2s

AI Response:
YES.

Explanation:
1. **Meetings Overlap**:
   - [13-16] overlaps with [13-14], [12-13], and [12-14].
   - [12-14] overlaps with [12-13] and [13-14].
   - [13-14] overlaps with [13-16] and [12-14].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 13, there are three meetings: [13-16], [12-14], and [13-14].
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - Since we have 2 available rooms, the maximum simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the number of available rooms (2).

However, based on the key insight that a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with a meeting starting at time T, and looking more closely:
- At time 13: [13-16] is still ongoing but [13-14] has just started. This means only two meetings are happening simultaneously.
- Therefore, the maximum simultaneous meetings do not exceed the number of available rooms.

Thus, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the two available rooms.

Current Strategy Being Used:
To determine if meetings can be scheduled:
1. Check which meetings overlap in time
2. Count the maximum number of meetings happening at the same time
3. If max_simultaneous <= num_rooms: YES (solvable)
4. If max_simultaneous > num_rooms: NO (impossible)

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 3.1s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - [10-11] and [11-12] overlap.
   - [11-12] and [12-15] overlap.
   - [12-15] and [14-15] partially overlap (14:00 to 15:00).
   
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: 
   At time 12:00, three meetings are happening simultaneously: [10-11], [11-12], and [12-15]. However, since the insight mentions that a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with a meeting starting at time T, we only consider the maximum number of overlapping intervals at any point in time. The correct maximum is 3 simultaneous meetings: [10-11] (ending), [11-12] (ending), and [12-15] (starting).

3. **Comparison to available rooms**: 
   With 2 available rooms, but a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings required, the answer is NO. Since the number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the number of available rooms (2), it's impossible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

AI Response:
YES.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: Meetings [15-17] and [13-16] do not overlap because the first meeting ends before the second one starts.
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: There are no overlapping times, so only one meeting can be happening at any given time. The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 1.
3. **Comparison to available rooms**: Since there are 3 available rooms and only 1 meeting needs to occur simultaneously, the condition `max_simultaneous <= num_rooms` is satisfied.

Therefore, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 4.7s

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Analysis**: 
   - Meeting [10-12] overlaps with [11-13].
   - Meeting [11-13] overlaps with [10-12] and [13-15].
   - Meeting [13-15] overlaps only with [11-13].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 11, meetings [10-12] and [11-13] are happening simultaneously (2 meetings).
   - At time 12, meeting [10-12] ends, but at the same time, [11-13] continues.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   - However, at any point in time, there are always 2 meetings happening simultaneously.
   
Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (3), it might initially seem solvable. But upon closer inspection:

- From 10:00 to 12:00, two rooms are needed continuously due to overlapping meetings.
- At 12:00, [10-12] ends but [11-13] continues until 13:00.

Since we need to ensure that at no point in time do more than 3 meetings overlap (which is not the case here), and since only 2 rooms are needed simultaneously for any period of time, the strategy works correctly:

Thus, the answer remains **NO**, because although the maximum simultaneous meetings (2) does not exceed the available rooms (3), we must consider the exact timing where two rooms would be used continuously from 10:00 to 12:00. Therefore, it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts as per the given strategy.

Final Answer: **YES**

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 1.8s

AI Response:
YES.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meeting [9-12] and [15-16] do not overlap because there is a gap between 12 and 15.
   
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At any given time, only one meeting can be happening since the two meetings are scheduled at different times (one ends before the other starts).
   - Therefore, the maximum number of meetings happening simultaneously is 1.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - Since there are 2 available rooms and only 1 meeting needs to be scheduled at any time, we have enough resources to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Thus, the answer is YES.

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Check**: The two meetings [14-15] and [15-18] do not overlap. Meeting 1 ends at time 15, while Meeting 2 starts at the same time but does not conflict as it lasts until time 18.
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**: At any given time, only one meeting is occurring (either from 14 to 15 or from 15 to 18). Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 1.
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**: Since there are 3 available rooms and only 1 meeting can occur at any given time, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

AI Response:
YES.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: The meetings [10-12] and [10-12] are the same meeting overlapping themselves, while [10-11] is a different meeting that ends before both of the others start at 12.
   
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: At any given time:
   - From 10:00 to 11:00, all three meetings are happening simultaneously ([10-12], [10-12], and [10-11]).
   - At 11:00 onwards, only two meetings remain: the first [10-12] and [10-11].

3. **Comparison to available rooms**: The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3, which matches exactly with the number of available rooms.

Therefore, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) does not exceed the number of available rooms (3).

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Analysis**: 
   - The meeting from 9-10 overlaps with the meeting from 10-12.
   - The meeting from 11-12 does not overlap with any other meetings as it starts after the first two meet and ends before they both finish.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 10, both meetings [9-10] and [10-12] are happening simultaneously.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 3.0s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - The meeting from 9-11 overlaps with the meeting from 10-13.
   - There is no conflict between any meeting and a meeting starting at the same time (e.g., [14-15] can start right after [9-11] ends).

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: 
   - At time 10, both meetings [9-11] and [10-13] are happening simultaneously.
   - Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - We have 2 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is equal to the number of available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings equals the number of available rooms, it's possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts. However, the question asks for a NO answer based on the given strategy where if max_simultaneous > num_rooms: NO (impossible). 

Therefore, in this specific case, despite not having more than the number of rooms, we must follow the stated rule and answer:

NO.

This is because the strategy strictly checks if the maximum simultaneous meetings exceed the available rooms, even though in this example they are equal.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 4.1s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - [10-12] and [12-13] overlap from 12:00 to 13:00.
   - No other meetings overlap with each other.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 12:00, two meetings are happening: [12-13] and [10-12].

3. **Comparison to available rooms**: 
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.
   - There are 3 available rooms.

Although the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) does not exceed the number of available rooms (3), we need to check if all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts. Since [10-12] and [12-13] overlap, they cannot both occur at the same time. However, we still have another meeting ([15-16]) that needs a room.

Given:
- Room usage: 
  - From 10:00 to 13:00, two meetings need rooms.
  - At any point in time from 10:00 to 13:00, only one meeting can be happening at once due to overlapping nature.

Since we have three rooms and the maximum simultaneous meetings required is only 2 (with an additional room available), all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts. However, based on the provided problem statement focusing on overlaps and simultaneous meetings:

- We need to ensure no time slot exceeds the number of rooms.
- The maximum overlap at any point in time is 2, which matches or leaves a room free.

Therefore, the correct answer should be **YES** as all meetings can fit within the given constraints.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 10:00, both meetings [9-10] and [10-12] are happening.
   - This gives us a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings (meeting [9-10] and meeting [10-12]).

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At any given time, only one meeting can be happening since the meetings are non-overlapping (e.g., during [10-13], only [10-13] is taking place; after that up to 15, there's no overlap with another meeting).
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - [9-12] overlaps with [10-12], [11-14].
   - [11-14] also overlaps with [11-13], [13-15].
   - [11-13] and [13-15] have no overlap.
   
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: 
   At time 11, the following meetings are happening:
   - [9-12]
   - [10-12]
   - [11-14]
   - [11-13]

   This gives a maximum of 4 simultaneous meetings at any given time.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**: 
   Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 4, and we have exactly 4 rooms available, it might seem like the problem can be solved. However, note that:
   - Meeting [10-12] ends at 12.
   - Meeting [9-12] ends at 12.

   By time 13, meeting [11-14] is still happening and overlaps with [13-15], meaning we would need an additional room to accommodate these overlapping meetings. Since only 4 rooms are available, this leads to a conflict where more than one room is needed for simultaneous meetings.

Therefore, it is impossible to schedule all the given meetings without conflicts.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**: 
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - There are only 2 available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the number of available rooms (2), it is impossible to schedule all meetings without conflicts. Therefore, the answer is NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meeting [15-18] starts at 15 and ends at 18.
   - Meeting [14-15] starts at 14 and ends at 15.
   - These two meetings do not overlap since the first one starts after the second one ends.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: 
   - At time 15, only meeting [15-18] is happening (1 meeting).
   - At time 16 to 17, only meeting [15-18] is happening (1 meeting).
   - At time 18, no meeting is happening.
   - The maximum number of meetings happening simultaneously is 1.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**: 
   - We have 2 rooms available, and the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 1.

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meeting [10-11] overlaps with meeting [10-13].
   - Meeting [10-13] overlaps with meeting [11-12].
   - Meetings [10-11], [10-13], and [11-12] overlap, meaning that at time 11, all three meetings are happening simultaneously.
   - Meeting [13-14] does not overlap with any other meeting.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 11, three meetings ([10-11], [10-13], and [11-12]) occur simultaneously.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - There are only 3 available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) equals the number of available rooms, it might seem solvable at first glance. However, we need to consider that all three overlapping meetings ([10-11], [10-13], and [11-12]) happen simultaneously at time 11, which means only one room can be used at this exact moment.

Therefore, it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 3.3s

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meeting [9-11] overlaps with both [11-12] and [11-13].
   - Meeting [11-12] overlaps with meeting [9-11] but not with [11-13].
   - Meeting [11-13] overlaps with meetings [9-11] and [11-12].

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   At time 11, the following meetings are happening simultaneously: [9-11], [11-12], and [11-13]. Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - However, at time 11, we need 3 rooms simultaneously.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) equals the number of available rooms, it might initially seem solvable. But notice that [9-12] also overlaps with [9-11] and [11-12], which means at time 11, we would need 4 rooms: one for each meeting starting or ending around this period.

Thus, because we cannot find a way to schedule all these meetings without having more than 3 rooms occupied simultaneously at some point, the answer is **NO**.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 4.5s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - [9-11] and [11-14] overlap from 11 to 11.
   - [15-18] overlaps with [15-16].
   - [14-17] overlaps with [15-18] from 15 to 17.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: 
   At time 15, there are three overlapping meetings: [9-11], [15-18], and [14-17]. Although [15-16] ends at the same time as these meetings start, it doesn't conflict with them. Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**: 
   Since we have a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings and only 4 rooms are available, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts because 3 ≤ 4.

However, upon re-evaluation:
- At time 15, [9-11] ends while [15-18] overlaps with [14-17].
- At time 16, only [15-18] and possibly another meeting start, but we still have a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings.

Thus, the correct answer is NO because although the overlap calculation initially suggests 3 simultaneous meetings, the problem states that a meeting ending at a specific time does not conflict with one starting at the same time. Therefore, the actual simultaneous meetings are [9-11], [14-17], and [15-18] which is still 3.

The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the available rooms (4), but there's a mistake in the initial comparison since the correct maximum should be 3, not more than 3. The correct answer is:

**YES**, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts given the problem constraints and re-evaluation.

Time: 2.6s

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - [9-10] and [10-11] overlap at 10.
   - There are no other overlaps among the given meetings.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 10, two meetings ([9-10] and [10-11]) are happening simultaneously.
   
3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is greater than the number of available rooms (3).

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) does not exceed the number of available rooms (3), it might seem solvable at first glance, but we need to check all time slots. However, in this case, the overlap only occurs between two specific meetings that can be scheduled separately without conflicts since one ends and another starts at the same point.

Given that the problem structure does not allow for more than 2 simultaneous meetings due to the overlaps, and there are exactly 3 rooms available, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts. Therefore, the correct answer is:

YES

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meetings [14-15] and [15-16] overlap.
   - Meetings [12-13] and [12-13] do not overlap (they are the same meeting).
   
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 14, two meetings are happening: [14-15] and [12-13].
   - At time 15, three meetings are happening: [14-15], [12-13], and [15-16].

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - There are only 3 available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) equals the number of available rooms, it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts under this strategy. However, upon re-evaluation based on your criteria and current strategy, we need to ensure there are no overlaps that cannot be resolved by room availability.

Given:
- [12-13] can happen at any time.
- At 14:00 - [12-13], [14-15] (2 meetings).
- At 15:00 - [12-13] ends, [14-15] ends, and [15-16] starts. 

Therefore, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts using the available 3 rooms.

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - [9-10] overlaps with [9-12]
   - [9-12] also overlaps with [10-12], and [15-17]
   - [10-12] does not overlap with any other meetings except those already mentioned.
   - [12-14] starts after [10-12] ends, so it does not conflict.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 9:00 to 10:00, there are two meetings happening simultaneously: [9-10] and [9-12].
   - From 10:00 to 12:00, three meetings overlap: [9-12], [10-12], and [15-17].

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) is greater than the available rooms (3).

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) equals the number of available rooms, but we need to ensure that all conflicts are handled properly and no room is overbooked at any point in time. However, from 10:00 to 12:00, three rooms would be required simultaneously, which matches the available rooms exactly. But the problem statement implies we must strictly avoid overlap without additional resources beyond what’s given.

Thus, while it appears that all can fit with just 3 rooms at peak times, practical scheduling might require more detailed planning to ensure no room is overbooked improperly between time slots. 

Given the constraints and current strategy focusing on maximum simultaneous usage:

**NO**, not all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts based on the given information.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - [11-14] and [11-12]: Overlap from 11:00 to 12:00.
   - [11-14] and [14-15]: Do not overlap since the latter starts after the former ends.
   - [13-16] and [14-15]: Overlap from 14:00 to 15:00.
   - No other overlaps are found.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 12:00, the meetings [11-12] and [11-14] overlap (2 meetings).
   - At time 14:00 to 15:00, the meetings [13-16] and [14-15] overlap (2 meetings).

The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings that can occur without conflicts is 2, which is less than the available 3 rooms.

However, since all meetings need to be scheduled and we have only 2 meeting slots where more than one meeting occurs simultaneously (12:00 and 14:00-15:00), it means that there are not enough room availability to schedule all of them without conflicts. Therefore, the answer is NO, not all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts with only 3 rooms available.

1. Check which meetings overlap in time

Explanation:

   - [9-11] overlaps with both [9-10] and [10-12].
   - [10-12] overlaps with [9-10], [10-13], and itself.
   - [10-13] starts after [10-12] ends, so it does not overlap with any other meetings.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   At time 10, the following meetings are happening simultaneously: [9-10], [10-12], and [10-13]. This gives us a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings at that point in time.
   
3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   Since we have only 3 rooms available and there can be up to 3 simultaneous meetings, the number of required rooms (3) equals the number of available rooms.

However, due to the overlap and the requirement for all meetings to occur without conflicts, specifically at time 10 when three meetings are happening simultaneously, it is clear that more than one room would need to be utilized at this peak time. Given only 3 rooms are available, the strategy checks if we can distribute these overlapping meetings across the available resources.

Thus, with three simultaneous meetings at the highest point and only three rooms, all meetings **can** be scheduled without conflicts based on the given strategy. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**YES**

Since we have exactly 3 meetings happening simultaneously and there are only 3 rooms available, it is feasible to schedule all meetings without conflicts. Therefore, the answer is:

**YES**

All meetings can be scheduled without conflicts given that the maximum simultaneous meetings (3) match the number of available rooms.

Current Strategy Being Used:
To determine if meetings can be scheduled:
1. Check which meetings overlap in time
2. Count the maximum number of meetings happening at the same time
3. If max_simultaneous <= num_rooms: YES (solvable)
4. If max_simultaneous > num_rooms: NO (impossible)

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 3.8s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - [9-10] and [10-11]: Overlap from 10:00 to 10:00 (end of the first meeting, start of the second).
   - [14-17], [14-17]: These are the same meeting; no overlap.
   - [10-13] and [10-11]: Overlap from 10:00 to 11:00.
   - [9-10], [10-13], [11-13]: These meetings all have overlapping segments:
     - [9-10] and [10-13]: Overlap from 10:00 to 10:00 (end of the first meeting, start of the second).
     - [10-11] and [11-13]: Overlap from 11:00 to 11:00 (end of the first meeting, start of the second).

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 10:00, three meetings are happening simultaneously: [9-10], [10-13], and [10-11]. This is the maximum number of overlapping meetings.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - There are only 2 available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the number of available rooms (2), it is impossible to schedule all the meetings without conflicts.

Therefore, the answer is NO.

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 2.0s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: The two meetings [14-16] and [11-13] do not overlap in time. Meeting 1 runs from 14:00 to 16:00, while Meeting 2 runs from 11:00 to 13:00.
   
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: Since the meetings do not conflict and there are no other meetings provided, only these two meetings need to be considered. The maximum number of simultaneous meetings at any point in time is 1.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**: There are 3 available rooms, which is more than enough for the single meeting that might occur simultaneously (in this case, none as they do not overlap).

Thus, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts since there are sufficient rooms and no overlapping times.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meeting 1: [13-16]
   - Meeting 2: [15-18]
   - The overlapping time between the two meetings is from 15 to 16.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 15, both meetings are happening simultaneously.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is equal to the number of available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings does not exceed the number of available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - [15-16] and [14-15] overlap.
   - [13-16] overlaps with both [15-16], [14-15], and [14-17].
   - [9-11] does not conflict with any other meeting as it ends before the earliest start time of the overlapping meetings.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: 
   - At time 13, there are three meetings starting: [13-16], [13-16], and [9-11]. However, we only consider the overlaps between each other.
   - At time 14, four meetings overlap: [15-16], [14-15], [13-16], and [14-17].
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 4.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**: 
   - Since there are only 2 available rooms, but a maximum of 4 meetings can overlap simultaneously, it's impossible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Thus, the answer is NO, as the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (4) exceeds the number of available rooms (2).

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Check**: 
   - Meeting [9-11] overlaps with none.
   - Meeting [11-13] overlaps with both [9-11] and [11-14].
   - Meeting [11-14] only overlaps with [11-13].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 11, meetings [9-11], [11-13], and [11-14] are happening simultaneously.
   - Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) equals the number of available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) does not exceed the number of available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 1.6s

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. The two meetings both have the time range [15-18], which means they completely overlap.
2. Since these two meetings occur at the exact same time, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.
3. There are 3 available rooms.

Although the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (3), this strategy does not account for the fact that both meetings cannot be scheduled simultaneously because they have the exact same time range. Therefore, even though there are enough rooms in theory, practically, we can only schedule one of these meetings.

Hence, all meetings CANNOT be scheduled without conflicts under the given constraints.

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: Meetings [9-11] and [14-15] do not overlap with any other meetings in terms of time slots. The overlapping meetings are [15-17] and [15-17], which means two meetings are happening from 15:00 to 17:00.
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: At the time slot of 15:00 to 17:00, there are exactly 2 meetings that need a room simultaneously.
3. **Comparison to available rooms**: Since we have 4 rooms available and only up to 2 meetings can occur at the same time, it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Therefore, all meetings can be scheduled without any issues given the availability of 4 rooms.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 3.5s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Overlap Analysis**: 
   - Meeting [10-13] and [12-13] overlap from 12:00 to 13:00.
   - Meeting [12-13] and [13-16] start at the end of each other's duration, so they do not conflict with each other but create a simultaneous booking period.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 13:00, both meetings [10-13] and [13-16] are happening simultaneously.
   - This means there will be two meetings happening at the same time from 13:00 to 13:00 (considering they just start/stop).

3. **Comparison with Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, which matches the number of available rooms.
   - However, since [10-13] and [12-13] overlap from 12:00 to 13:00, they both need a room at the same time as [13-16], making it impossible to schedule all meetings without conflict.

Therefore, due to the simultaneous requirement of two rooms during 13:00 and the overlapping nature of some meetings, not all meetings can be scheduled with only 2 available rooms.

1. Check which meetings overlap in time

AI Response:
YES.

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Check**: The two meetings do not overlap in time. Meeting [15-17] starts at 15 and ends at 17, while meeting [13-14] starts at 13 and ends at 14. Since there is no overlap between these times, they can be scheduled simultaneously without conflict.
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**: Although both meetings are happening at the same time (15 to 17), only one meeting will be occurring at any given minute within this range. Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 1.
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**: With 2 available rooms and a maximum of 1 meeting happening simultaneously, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, the answer is YES.

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meeting [11-14] overlaps with [11-13], [14-16].
   - Meeting [14-16] overlaps with [11-14], [15-18].
   - Meeting [15-18] overlaps with [14-16].

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 14, the following meetings are happening simultaneously: [11-14], [14-16], and [15-18]. This is a maximum of 3 meetings.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - Since there are only 3 available rooms and the maximum number of simultaneous meetings at time 14 is also 3, it means all three meetings can be scheduled without conflicts. However, if we consider the meeting [15-18] starting right after [14-16] ends, this would also require a room, leading to the same scenario where exactly 3 rooms are used at any given time.

In conclusion, since there are no more than 3 meetings happening simultaneously and there are exactly 3 available rooms, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts. The initial analysis suggested NO due to misinterpreting the situation; in reality, it is possible to schedule all meetings with the given resources.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - [9-12] overlaps with [10-11], [11-12]

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 9:00 to 11:00, we have two meetings happening simultaneously: [9-12] and [10-11].
   - At time 14:00 to 15:00, we have three meetings happening simultaneously: [14-17], [14-15], and another instance of [14-15].

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) is equal to the number of available rooms, it appears at first glance that all meetings can be scheduled.

However, we must consider the exact time overlaps:

- At 14:00 to 15:00, three meetings are happening simultaneously. This exceeds the available room capacity since there are only 3 rooms but four instances of a meeting starting between 14:00 and 15:00 (two [14-17] and two [14-15]).

Therefore, even though the maximum simultaneous meetings do not exceed the number of available rooms at any single moment, we cannot fit all these overlapping meetings into three rooms without conflicts. Thus, it is impossible to schedule all these meetings without conflicts given the constraints.

   - Meetings [14-15] and [14-16] partially overlap (overlapping at 14).

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 14, there are two meetings happening: [14-15] and [14-16].
   - From 15 to 18, only one meeting is taking place, but this does not affect the maximum since it's already reached at 14.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.
   - However, there are 3 meetings happening simultaneously at time 14 (two ongoing and one just starting).

   - Meeting [12-13] only overlaps with [11-14].
   - Meeting [13-16] starts after [12-13] ends, so they do not overlap.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 11:00, meetings [9-11] and [11-14] are happening simultaneously.
   - At time 12:00, meetings [11-14] and [12-13] are happening simultaneously.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - There are 3 available rooms, but the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.
   - Since max_simultaneous (2) <= num_rooms (3), we might think it’s solvable at first glance, but let's check the entire schedule:

Considering the full timeline:
- From 9:00 to 11:00, meeting [9-11] is happening.
- From 11:00 to 12:00, both meetings [9-11] and [11-14] are happening (conflict).
- From 12:00 to 13:00, both meetings [11-14] and [12-13] are happening (conflict).

Since there is a conflict when two or more meetings overlap at the same time and we only have 3 rooms available, it’s not possible to schedule all these meetings without conflicts.

Therefore, the answer is NO.

Time: 4.3s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Overlap of Meetings**:
   - Meeting [9-10] and [10-13] overlap from 10:00 to 10:10.
   - Meeting [13-15] does not overlap with any other meeting until its end time at 15:00.
   - Meetings [14-17], [14-16], and [14-15] all start from 14:00, which means they are concurrent.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At 14:00, three meetings start simultaneously: [14-17], [14-16], and [14-15]. This is the maximum number of simultaneous meetings.
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Since there are 4 rooms available, but we have identified that at least 3 meetings must be scheduled simultaneously (from the overlap analysis), it means all required room capacity can be met.

However, upon closer inspection, notice that while three concurrent meetings from 14:00 to 15:00 can fit within the four available rooms, there is a conflict at other times as well:
   - From 9:00 to 10:10, two meetings ([9-10] and [10-13]) are happening.
   - Between 14:00 and 15:00, three meetings overlap.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) is more than the available rooms (4), we can conclude that all meetings cannot be scheduled without conflicts. The correct response considering the problem constraints is:

**NO**, because at least one time slot requires more than four rooms to accommodate all concurrent meetings.

Current Strategy Being Used:
To determine if meetings can be scheduled:
1. Check which meetings overlap in time
2. Count the maximum number of meetings happening at the same time
3. If max_simultaneous <= num_rooms: YES (solvable)

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meeting [15-18] overlaps with: [15-17], [15-16]
   - Meeting [15-17] overlaps with: [15-18], [15-16]
   - Meeting [12-15] overlaps with: [15-17], [15-16]
   - Meeting [15-16] overlaps with: [15-18], [15-17], [12-15]

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   At time 15, multiple meetings are happening simultaneously:
   - [15-18]
   - [15-17]
   - [15-16]

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   The maximum number of simultaneous meetings at any given time is 3, which exceeds the number of available rooms (2).

Therefore, since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) is greater than the number of available rooms (2), it is impossible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: The meetings [11-14] and [9-11] overlap in time.
   - Meeting 1: [9-11]
   - Meeting 2: [11-14]
   - Meeting 3: [11-14]

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: At the overlapping times (specifically, from 11 to 14), all three meetings are happening simultaneously.
   - Maximum number of simultaneous meetings = 3

3. **Comparison to available rooms**: There are only 3 available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) is equal to the number of available rooms, but we need to ensure that the rooms can be utilized without any conflicts. In this case, all three overlapping meetings cannot be scheduled at the same time because they require more than the available number of rooms.

Thus, it's not possible to schedule all these meetings without conflicts given only 3 rooms.

Problem: [9-12], [10-13], [9-12] | 2 rooms (max_simultaneous=3)
Expected: NO | Got: NO | ✓
Time: 3.5s

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Analysis**: 
   - Meeting [9-12] overlaps with both [9-12] and [10-13].
   - Meeting [10-13] only overlaps with [9-12].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 10, both meetings [9-12] and [10-13] are happening simultaneously.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 2 available rooms, but we need at least 2 rooms for the overlapping meetings from time 10 onwards.
   - Since max_simultaneous (2) equals num_rooms (2), it seems solvable. However, note that [9-12] overlaps with itself, which is not a valid scenario in this problem since it would imply two instances of the same meeting, and we only have one instance here.

Given these points, while there are no conflicts between different meetings due to the rule that a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with another starting at T, the overlapping requirement still necessitates 2 rooms for the period from 10 to 12. Since we have exactly 2 rooms available, this specific case is solvable.

However, considering the structure strictly and assuming no duplicate meetings, the answer remains:
**YES**

The meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the two available rooms.

Time: 3.4s

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Analysis**: 
   - Meetings [12-15] and [10-12] overlap with meeting [12-13].
   - Meetings do not directly conflict at the exact transition points (e.g., a meeting ending at 15:00 does not conflict with one starting at 15:00, but they cannot occupy the same room during that time).

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 12:00, three meetings are happening simultaneously: [12-13], [10-12], and [12-15]. This is the maximum number of simultaneous meetings.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Since there are 3 rooms available, but we have a situation where up to 3 meetings need to happen simultaneously, the number of required resources (max_simultaneous) equals the number of available rooms.
   
However, the strategy checks for cases where max_simultaneous > num_rooms. In this case, max_simultaneous is exactly equal to num_rooms, which means it's on the edge but still solvable as long as there are enough unique time slots without conflicts. Yet, since we have a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings and only 3 rooms, all can be scheduled.

The correct answer should be YES because although the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is equal to the number of available rooms, they do not conflict in terms of scheduling.

Explanation:
1. **Meetings Overlap**:
   - [9-12]: Covers from 9:00 to 12:00.
   - [10-12], [11-14], [12-13]: All partially overlap with the first meeting.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 10, meetings [10-12] and [9-12] are happening simultaneously.
   - At time 11, meetings [10-12], [11-14], and [9-12] are happening simultaneously.
   - At time 12, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3: [10-12], [11-14], and [9-12].

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meeting [9-10] overlaps with meeting [10-11].
   - There are no other overlaps between the given meetings.
   
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 10, two meetings are happening: [9-10] and [10-11]. 
   - Between times 12 and 15, only one meeting is happening (but it's just before another starts without overlap).
   
3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.
   - Since we have 3 available rooms, but the max simultaneous meetings is 2, all meetings can still be scheduled without conflicts.

However, there was a misunderstanding in the problem statement regarding the key insight: "A meeting ending at time T does NOT conflict with a meeting starting at time T." This means that if one meeting ends exactly when another starts, they do not overlap. Therefore, let's re-evaluate:

- At 10, [9-10] and [10-11] are indeed overlapping.
- From 12 to 15, we have only one meeting which does not cause any conflict with the previous meetings.

Given this understanding:
- The maximum simultaneous meetings is still 2 (at time 10).
- Since we have 3 rooms available and the max simultaneous meetings is 2, it is indeed possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Therefore, the correct answer should be **YES**.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meetings [9-10] and [9-11] overlap.
   - Meeting [9-11] and [11-14] overlap at 11.
   - Meetings [9-10], [9-11], and [12-15] all start before [11-14].

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   At time 10, the following meetings are happening simultaneously: [9-10], [9-11], and [12-15]. This is the maximum number of overlapping meetings.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) is equal to the number of available rooms, but since each room can only host one meeting at a time, and we have 3 simultaneous meetings that cannot fit in just 3 rooms due to overlap, it's impossible to schedule all these meetings without conflicts.

Therefore, not all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - [15-18] and [11-13] do not overlap.
   - [11-13] overlaps with [11-12].
   - [11-12] does not overlap with any other meeting (since it's the start of a longer meeting).
   - [11-14] starts during [11-12] and ends after, so it overlaps partially with both [11-12] and extends beyond.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 11:00, we have [11-13], [11-12], and [11-14]. This is the maximum number of meetings happening simultaneously, which is 3.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - Since the maximum simultaneous meetings are 3, and there are only 3 available rooms, theoretically, all meetings could be scheduled without conflicts if no further constraints (like room sizes or capacities) were present.
   - However, in this specific case, we need to ensure that each meeting can find a unique room at its required time slots. The overlapping of [11-12] with both [11-13] and [11-14] means these three meetings cannot be scheduled simultaneously on different rooms.

Given the overlap and the number of available rooms, it's impossible to schedule all these meetings without conflicts due to the simultaneous need for at least 3 rooms. Therefore, the answer is NO.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 3.4s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Analysis**: 
   - Meetings [9-11] and [11-12] overlap at 11.
   - Meetings [12-15] start after the end of [9-11], so they do not overlap with each other directly, but we need to consider their simultaneous occurrence.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 11, meetings [9-11] and [11-12] are happening simultaneously.
   - At times 12 and beyond, both meetings [9-11] (ending at 11) and [12-15] start to occur simultaneously.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, which occurs at time 11.
   - Since we have exactly 2 rooms available, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts under the given strategy.

However, upon re-evaluating the problem with the correct interpretation that a meeting ending at T does not conflict with starting another one at T:

- The simultaneous maximum number of meetings is still 2 (at time 11), but since we have exactly 2 rooms available and no overlap constraints beyond this point, the solution should be:
  
YES.

All meetings can be scheduled without conflicts as they do not exceed the available room count of 2 at any given time.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: The meeting from 10-12 overlaps with the meeting from 15-16 because there is a time slot between 12 and 15 where no other meetings are scheduled.
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: At any given time, only two meetings can be happening simultaneously (from 10 to 12). There is an empty gap between the end of one meeting and the start of another that does not conflict with scheduling both meetings in the same room.
3. **Comparison to available rooms**: With three available rooms, we have enough resources to schedule all meetings without conflicts since only two simultaneous meetings are needed at most.

Thus, given three available rooms, it is possible to schedule both meetings [15-16] and [10-12] without any conflicts.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - We have exactly 3 available rooms.

Although the number of simultaneous meetings equals the number of available rooms, we still cannot schedule all meetings because [15-17], [12-15], and [14-16] overlap at time 15. Therefore, it is impossible to schedule these meetings without conflicts using only 3 rooms.

   - [15-17] is isolated and does not conflict with any of the others.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 13: Two meetings are happening simultaneously: [10-13] (which finishes at 13) and [13-14].
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 3 rooms available.
   - However, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings happening is 2, which means we still cannot utilize all three rooms for scheduling these meetings without conflicts.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (3), in theory, it seems feasible. But considering practical scheduling where overlapping sessions need distinct resources at their peak times, and given that two meetings are happening simultaneously during part of the schedule, it means all three rooms would be utilized at some point which aligns with our strategy.

However, upon reevaluation focusing strictly on simultaneous usage:
- Room 1: [10-13]
- Room 2: [13-14], [15-17] (could potentially use another room)
- Room 3: Unutilized

This shows while theoretically fitting under the strategy, practical overlap conflicts necessitate NO as a definitive answer due to resource constraints.

Current Strategy Being Used:
To determine if meetings can be scheduled:
1. Check which meetings overlap in time
2. Count the maximum number of meetings happening at the same time
3. If max_simultaneous <= num_rooms: YES (solvable)

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: The two meetings [9-12] and [15-18] do not overlap in time. Meeting 1 ends at 12, while Meeting 2 starts at 15.
   
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: 
   - At any given time, only one meeting is occurring since the meetings are disjoint (no overlapping times).
   
3. **Comparison to available rooms**: Since there are no simultaneous conflicts and we have 3 available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, with 3 available rooms and non-overlapping meetings, it's possible to schedule both meetings successfully.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 2.7s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meetings [10-11] and [11-14] both start at 10 or after, but one ends before the other starts, so they do not conflict.
   - Meeting [11-13] overlaps with meeting [10-11] for time range [11-11].
   - Meeting [11-13] also overlaps with meeting [11-14] from 11 to 13.
   - Meeting [14-17] starts after the earliest end of other meetings, so it does not conflict with any.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 11:00, meetings [11-13], [10-11], and [11-14] are happening simultaneously.
   - This results in a maximum of 3 meetings happening at the same time.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - Since there are only 2 rooms available, but the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3, it's impossible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Therefore, the answer is NO.

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meeting [15-17] and [10-12] do not overlap.
   - Meeting [15-17] and [12-13] do not overlap.
   - Meeting [12-13] and [10-12] partially overlap from 12 to 13.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 12, there are two meetings happening: [10-12] and [12-13].
   
3. **Comparison to available rooms**: 
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.
   - We have exactly 2 rooms available.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) equals the number of available rooms, it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts. However, based on your problem statement and strategy, if we follow strictly:

- **If max_simultaneous <= num_rooms: YES** (solvable)
- **If max_simultaneous > num_rooms: NO** (impossible)

In this case, the correct answer is **YES**, as 2 simultaneous meetings do not exceed the available 2 rooms.

Problem: [13-14], [11-12], [13-16], [9-11] | 2 rooms (max_simultaneous=2)
Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 4.8s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Meetings and Overlaps**:
   - Meeting 1: [9-11]
   - Meeting 2: [11-12]
   - Meeting 3: [13-14]
   - Meeting 4: [13-16]

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 13, both meetings [13-14] and [13-16] are happening simultaneously.
   - This results in a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 2 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, which matches the number of available rooms.

However, we need to consider the entire schedule:
- From 9 to 11: Meeting [9-11] is happening (1 meeting).
- At 11: Both Meeting [9-11] ends and Meeting [11-12] starts.
- From 11 to 12: Meetings [11-12] and [13-14] are happening simultaneously (2 meetings).
- From 13 to 16: Meetings [13-14] and [13-16] are happening simultaneously (2 meetings).

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, which matches the number of available rooms, it might seem solvable. However, at time 13, both [13-14] and [13-16] start, leading to a situation where we have 2 meetings happening simultaneously.

Given that:
- Meeting [9-11] ends exactly when Meeting [11-12] starts.
- The overlap between [13-14] and [13-16] at time 13 is critical as it requires both rooms to be occupied.

Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) does not exceed the available rooms (2), but due to the exact timing, we cannot schedule all meetings without conflicts. Therefore, the answer is NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: The meeting from 15-17 overlaps with the meeting from 13-16 because there is an overlap in time between 15 and 16.
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: At any given time, at most two meetings can occur simultaneously: one starting after 13 and ending before or at 16, and another overlapping with it (from 15 to 17).
3. **Comparison to available rooms**: Since there are 2 available rooms and the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is also 2, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, YES, all meetings can be scheduled without any conflicts given the two available rooms.

Time: 3.1s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meetings [9-10] and [9-10] overlap.
   - Meetings [9-10] and [10-11] overlap at time 10.
   - Meetings [10-11] and [11-12] start at the same time but do not conflict.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 10, three meetings are happening: [9-10], [9-10], and [10-11].

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - Maximum simultaneous meetings = 3
   - Available rooms = 3

While the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) is equal to the number of available rooms, this does not guarantee that all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts due to overlapping times. Specifically, at time 10, three meetings are happening, which means only one room is needed for these overlapping meetings.

However, since there are no additional resources or constraints like priorities or preferences, and the current strategy correctly identifies if the number of simultaneous meetings exceeds the available rooms, the answer is NO because having all meetings scheduled would require more concurrent usage than the three available rooms can handle.

Explanation:

1. **Overlap Check**: 
   - Meeting [12-13] and [9-12] do not overlap because the first meeting starts at 12:00, which is after the second meeting ends at 12:00.
   
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At any given time, only one of these meetings can be happening. Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 1.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 4.2s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meetings [10-11] and [10-12] overlap from 10:00 to 11:00.
   - Meeting [15-16] is ongoing when meeting [14-16] starts, but there's no direct overlap since the end of one does not conflict with the start of another.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: 
   - At 10:00 to 11:00, we have two overlapping meetings ([10-11] and [10-12]).
   - From 14:00 to 16:00, three meetings are happening simultaneously (one meeting starts at 14:00, one at 15:00, and one ends at 16:00).

3. **Comparison to available rooms**: 
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - Since we have exactly 3 rooms available, the strategy would suggest that it's solvable if this number equals or is less than the number of rooms.

However, there’s a critical point: while each meeting can start and end at the same time without conflict, scheduling them all simultaneously requires sufficient room availability. Here, having three meetings happen concurrently (from 14:00 to 16:00) means we need exactly 3 rooms for this period.

Since the maximum simultaneous meetings is 3, and we have precisely 3 available rooms:
- The strategy would indicate it's solvable because `max_simultaneous <= num_rooms`.
- But the problem specifies that only time ranges are considered, which implies no overlap in usage at specific times (like multiple starts or ends happening simultaneously).

Given the constraints provided and focusing solely on time overlaps without considering other scheduling complexities, the solution is feasible with the exact room count.

Final Answer: YES.

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Analysis**: 
   - Meeting [14-17] and meeting [14-16] overlap from 14:00 to 16:00.
   - There is no conflict between meetings ending at the same time, so meeting [14-17] can end as soon as meeting [14-16] ends.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**: 
   - At time 14:00 to 15:00, both meetings [14-16] and [14-17] are happening simultaneously.
   - This results in a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings at any given time.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**: 
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, and we have 3 available rooms, it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

However, upon reevaluation:
- At 14:00 to 15:00, two meetings are happening simultaneously.
- From 15:00 to 16:00, both [14-17] and [14-16] end, but we still have meeting [10-13] which starts at 10:00 and ends at 13:00.
- At 12:00 to 13:00, there is another simultaneous meeting with [10-13] and either of the other meetings that started before 12:00.

Therefore, since we have a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings at any given time:
- The requirement is met as we only need up to 3 rooms (two for the overlapping period from 14:00 to 15:00 and one for [10-13] which does not overlap with others until 12:00).

The correct answer should be **YES**.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meeting [14-15] and [11-14] overlap from 14:00 to 15:00.
   - Meeting [15-17] starts right after [14-15] ends, so it does not overlap with any meeting that has already ended at time T.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At 14:00, two meetings are happening simultaneously: [14-15] and [11-14].
   - The maximum number of meetings happening at the same time is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - We have 3 available rooms.

Explanation:
1. **Meetings Overlap**: 
   - [10-11] overlaps with [10-11]
   - [9-11] overlaps with [10-11], [10-11]

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   At time 10, three meetings are happening simultaneously: [10-11], [10-11], and [9-11]. Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**: 
   Since there are only 3 available rooms but we have a scenario where 3 meetings overlap at the same time, this exceeds the number of available rooms (which is exactly 3).

Given that the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) equals the number of available rooms, it means all overlapping meetings can be scheduled without conflicts. However, since no room would be left for non-overlapping meetings in between, and given the definition where a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with a meeting starting at time T, we conclude that:

- All overlapping meetings [10-11], [9-11] can indeed share rooms.
- The total number of simultaneous meetings (3) matches the available rooms.

Thus, all given meetings can be scheduled without conflicts. The initial assessment led to an incorrect conclusion due to a misinterpretation; therefore, the correct answer is:

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings:**
   - At time 9, we have [9-11] starting.
   - From 10 to 11, we have [9-11] and [10-12] happening simultaneously (2 meetings).
   - At time 11, [9-11] ends, but [13-15] starts, so at this point, we see:
     - [10-12]
     - [11-14] which overlaps with [10-12] and [12-13].
     - [13-15]
   - At time 13, both [12-13] ends and [13-15] is happening.
   - So, from 11 to 13, we have [10-12], [11-14], and [13-15] (3 meetings).

3. **Comparison to available rooms:**
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3, which matches the number of available rooms.
   - However, at time 11, there are actually 4 meetings happening simultaneously:
     - [9-11] ends but starts counting towards overlap.
     - [10-12]
     - [11-14]
     - [13-15].
   - This results in a maximum of 4 simultaneous meetings.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (4) exceeds the available rooms (3), all meetings cannot be scheduled without conflicts. Therefore, the answer is NO.

To determine if meetings can be scheduled:
1. Check which meetings overlap in time

AI Response:
YES.

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Check**: The two meetings are [10-12] and [11-12]. These meetings do not overlap because the first meeting ends at 12, which is exactly when the second meeting starts.
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**: Since there are no overlapping times, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 (one for each time slot).
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**: There are 2 available rooms and the maximum simultaneous meetings are also 2. Therefore, max_simultaneous <= num_rooms.

Given that the number of required rooms (2) does not exceed the available rooms (2), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Overlap of Meetings**:
   - Meeting [9-12] overlaps with both [11-13] and [12-14].
   - Meeting [15-17] does not overlap with any other meetings.
   - Meetings [11-13], [12-14] partially overlap.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 11, there are three meetings happening simultaneously: [9-12], [11-13], and [12-14].
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3, which equals the number of available rooms, theoretically, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.
   - However, because there are three meetings happening at time 11 simultaneously, and only 3 rooms are available, we need to ensure that these three meetings can indeed occur in different rooms.

In this case, since the maximum simultaneous meetings (3) equals the number of available rooms (3), it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts. Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Analysis**: 
   - Meeting [9-10] does not conflict with any other meeting as it ends before the next meetings start.
   - Meeting [11-14] overlaps with [11-13] and [13-16].
   - Meeting [11-13] overlaps only with [11-14] but not with [13-16] as it ends before the latter starts.
   - Meeting [13-16] starts after [11-14] ends and thus does not conflict.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   At time 11, meetings [11-14] and [11-13] are happening simultaneously. This gives us a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   Since we have exactly 2 rooms available, and the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is also 2, it seems feasible that all meetings could be scheduled. However, we need to ensure there's no conflict in scheduling these simultaneously happening meetings into separate rooms.

Upon further examination:
- Meeting [9-10] can be scheduled without conflicts.
- Meetings [11-14] and [11-13] must share a room as they happen at the same time, leaving us with only 1 available room for other overlapping or non-overlapping meetings.

Since we run out of rooms when trying to schedule all these simultaneous meetings, it is impossible to accommodate all meetings without conflicts given the constraint of having only 2 rooms.

Thus, the answer remains **NO**.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 3.3s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - [14-16] overlaps with none.
   - [11-13] overlaps with [12-14].
   - [12-14] overlaps with [11-13] and [14-16].
   - [10-11] does not overlap with any other meeting.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 12, there are three meetings happening simultaneously: [11-13], [12-14], and [10-11].

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - There are 4 available rooms.

However, the key point here is that although there are only 4 rooms available, at least one time slot has 3 meetings happening simultaneously (time 12). Since the problem states that a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with a meeting starting at time T, we need to ensure that no more than 3 meetings occur at any given time. With only 4 rooms available and needing to accommodate up to 3 simultaneous meetings, this is feasible.

Given the current strategy and the specific problem constraints, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts because the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) does not exceed the available rooms (4).

Therefore, the correct answer is **YES**.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: The meetings [10-13] and [14-16] do not overlap in time. Meeting [10-13] ends at 13, and meeting [14-16] starts after that.
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: At any given time, only one of these meetings is happening (either the meeting from 10 to 13 or the meeting from 14 to 16). Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 1.

Hence, YES, all meetings can be scheduled without any conflicts.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 12, meetings [10-12] and [11-13] are happening simultaneously.
   - No more than two meetings are occurring at any single moment.

Explanation:

   - [10-12] also overlaps with [14-16], [14-17]
   - [10-13] overlaps with [14-16], [14-17]
   - [14-16] and [14-17] do not overlap as one ends at 16 and the other starts at 17.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   At time 10, there are three meetings happening simultaneously: [9-12], [10-13], and [10-12]. Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**: 
   Since we have only 4 rooms and a maximum of 3 meetings occurring at the same time would not exceed this capacity (3 < 4), it might seem solvable. However, upon closer inspection, we need to consider if we can schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Upon further analysis:
- If [9-12] uses one room.
- Then [10-13] and [10-12] would use another room each at time 10, requiring a total of 3 rooms at that moment.
- This leaves us with only 1 room available to schedule [14-16] or [14-17], but both start after the critical period where three meetings are already happening.

Therefore, it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts. The answer is NO.

Time: 5.1s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap:**
   - [12-13] and [13-14] overlap.
   - [10-11] and [10-13] overlap.
   - [14-17] does not directly overlap with any other meeting, but it starts after some meetings have ended.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings:**
   - At time 13:00, both [12-13] and [13-14] are happening simultaneously.
   - At time 10:00, both [10-11] and [10-13] are happening simultaneously.

Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms:**
   - We have only 2 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need to be scheduled at the same time is also 2.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) equals the number of available rooms, it seems theoretically possible. However, we need to consider if these meetings can be scheduled without conflict over their entire duration.

- At time 10:00 to 11:00, [10-11] and [10-13] are happening simultaneously.
- At time 12:00 to 13:00, [12-13] and [13-14] are happening simultaneously.

Given the structure of the problem where a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with another starting at time T, we can see that both sets of meetings overlap in such a way that they cannot be scheduled without some conflicts. Specifically:

- If we allocate one room to [10-13], it will block any other meetings from using that room between 10:00 and 13:00.
- Similarly, if we allocate another room to [12-13] and [13-14], those meetings will also overlap with the previous set of meetings.

Therefore, because two sets of simultaneous meetings (each requiring a unique room) cannot be scheduled without overlapping in time, it is impossible to schedule all meetings given only 2 rooms.

1. Check which meetings overlap in time

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Meetings that overlap**:
   - [13-15] overlaps with [13-15]
   - [9-11] does not overlap with any other meeting.
   
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 13, the following meetings are happening: [13-15], [13-15]. This results in a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings.
   - At time 14, the following meetings are happening: [13-15], [13-15]. This also results in a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - We have 3 rooms available.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (3), it appears that all meetings could potentially be scheduled without conflicts based on the strategy. However, we need to consider the specific overlap:

- [13-15] and [13-15] happen at the same time.
- There are no other overlapping times.

With 3 rooms available and only 2 simultaneous meetings needed, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, the correct answer is YES.

Time: 5.2s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meetings [9-10] and [9-11] both start before 11:00, but only [9-10] ends before the other.
   - Meetings [14-16] and [14-16] (repeated) clearly overlap as they are exactly the same.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: 
   - At time 9:00 to 10:00, both meetings [9-10] and [9-11] are happening simultaneously.
   - At time 14:00 to 16:00, two of the [14-16] meetings are happening simultaneously.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**: 
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is equal to the number of available rooms (2). However, this scenario only considers a single instance where all meetings overlap.
   - In another critical time slot 9:00-10:00, there are two meetings happening simultaneously which matches exactly with the capacity but we need to check if it's possible to spread these over different time slots without conflicts.

Given that at any point in time up to 2 meetings are happening and this is equal to the number of available rooms, initially it seems solvable. However, let’s look closely:

- At 9:00 - 10:00, [9-10] and [9-11] overlap.
- At 14:00 - 16:00, two [14-16] meetings overlap.

Since both critical time slots involve exactly 2 simultaneous meetings which equals the number of rooms available, there is no conflict in terms of room availability at any point. 

However, due to the nature of how the problem states that a meeting ending at T does not conflict with one starting at T, and given all overlapping times are within the constraints, we can conclude:

The strategy indicates NO because although 2 rooms are enough for simultaneous meetings, they need to be spread across different time slots which isn't possible without conflicts. Therefore, it's impossible to schedule all meetings without having more than 2 meetings happening at the same time in some slot.

Thus, the final answer is **NO**.

Explanation:

   - Meeting [11-13] overlaps with meeting [12-15] from time 12 to 13.
   - Meeting [13-16] overlaps with both [11-13] and [12-15] from times 13 to 15.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 13, three meetings are happening simultaneously: [9-10], [11-13], and [13-16].

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3, but we only have 2 rooms available (as the problem states there are 3 rooms), it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 13, two meetings are happening: [12-14] and [13-15].
   
3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.
   - Since we have only 2 rooms available, it seems like the solution should be possible based on this information alone.

However, upon closer inspection, we realize that while two rooms are sufficient for any single moment in time (13), there's a sequence where both of these rooms would be occupied by different meetings consecutively. Specifically:
- At 12:00 to 13:00, one room is used by [12-14].
- At 13:00 to 14:00 and 14:00 to 15:00, the other meeting [13-15] would need that same room.

Thus, while at no point do more than two meetings overlap in time, the exact arrangement of these overlapping periods over time means only 2 rooms are not sufficient. Therefore, it is impossible to schedule all these meetings without conflicts given only 2 rooms.

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 1.6s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: The meeting [15-16] starts at 15 and ends at 16, while the meeting [10-11] starts at 10 and ends at 11. There is no overlap between these two meetings since they occur in different time slots.
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: Since there are only two meetings and they do not overlap, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.
3. **Comparison to available rooms**: With 3 available rooms and a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings, we can accommodate all meetings without conflicts.

Thus, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Problem: [9-10], [13-16], [13-15], [13-16] | 4 rooms (max_simultaneous=3)
Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 3.5s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - [9-10] and [13-16], [13-15], [13-16] do not overlap.
   - [13-16] overlaps with both [13-15] and [13-16].
   
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 13, the following meetings are happening: [13-15], [13-16]. 
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - There are 4 available rooms.
   - However, at any given time (specifically at time 13), there are 2 meetings happening simultaneously.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) does not exceed the number of available rooms (4), initially it might seem solvable. But we need to consider the entire schedule:

- [9-10] can be scheduled.
- [13-16], [13-15], and [13-16] all overlap at time 13, meaning that even though only up to 2 rooms are needed simultaneously, these three meetings require a room each during their entire duration.

Given the constraints of having exactly one meeting per room at any given moment, we cannot schedule all these meetings without conflicts because there is no way to fit all 3 overlapping meetings from time 13 onwards into the available rooms. Therefore, the answer is NO.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 3.5s

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Identification**: 
   - [14-15] overlaps with both [14-15] and [15-18].
   - [11-13] does not overlap with any other meeting.
   - [15-18] overlaps with [14-15] only at the end.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 14, there are 3 meetings happening: [14-15], [14-15], and [15-18].
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**: 
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - There are only 3 available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) equals the number of available rooms, it seems possible that all meetings could be scheduled without conflicts at first glance. However, let's double-check for any potential issues:

- At time 14: [14-15], [14-15] and [15-18] are happening simultaneously.
- At time 15: [14-15] ends, but [15-18] is still happening. So we have [15-18] alone at this moment, which doesn't increase the count.

Given that all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts by managing them through the available rooms (as each room handles one of the overlapping times), the answer remains:

**YES**, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

1. **Overlap Check**: The two meetings [15-16] and [9-12] do not overlap in time. Meeting 1 starts at 15 and ends at 16, while meeting 2 starts at 9 and ends at 12.
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**: Since the meetings do not overlap, there are never more than one meeting happening simultaneously.
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**: With only 1 meeting occurring at any given time and having 2 available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, it is possible to schedule both meetings with the available resources.

YES

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [11-13]
   - Meeting 2: [11-12]
   - Meeting 3: [13-15]

   Meetings 1 and 2 overlap from time 11 to 12.
   Meetings 1 and 3 start at different times but do not conflict since a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with a meeting starting at time T.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 11, both Meeting 1 (11-13) and Meeting 2 (11-12) are happening simultaneously.
   - At time 13, only Meeting 1 (13-15) is ongoing.
   
   The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need to be scheduled is 2.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (3), all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 4.9s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Overlap Identification**:
   - Meeting [9-10] overlaps with [10-11].
   - Meetings [12-14] and [12-15] overlap.
   - Meetings [13-15], [12-14], and [12-15] all start or end around the same time, indicating potential conflicts.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   At time 13:00, three meetings are happening simultaneously:
   - Meeting [12-15]
   - Meeting [12-14]
   - Meeting [13-15]

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3, which is greater than the available rooms (4). However, since no more than 3 meetings can occur at the same time, and we have 4 rooms available, it seems initially possible.

Upon closer inspection, the key insight that a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with a meeting starting at time T means:
- [10-11] ends at 11, allowing for other meetings to start from 11 onwards.
- Similarly, [15-16] starts after all current overlaps end.

Given this insight and recalculating the maximum simultaneous meetings correctly:

At time 13:00:
   - Meeting [12-14] ends
   - Meeting [13-15] starts

Thus, at any given moment, only two or three meetings can occur simultaneously. The highest number of simultaneous meetings is still 3 (as previously identified), but with the understanding that these can be managed with the available rooms.

However, due to overlapping start and end times:
   - [9-10] and [10-11]
   - [12-14], [12-15], [13-15]

We need at least 4 simultaneous slots to manage these overlaps properly. Therefore:

**Answer: NO**. The meetings cannot all be scheduled without conflicts, as the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the available rooms when considering overlapping times correctly.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: The meeting [14-15] ends at 15, and the meeting [15-18] starts immediately after it. Therefore, these two meetings overlap from 15:00 to 15:00.
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: Although they overlap at exactly one point (15:00), we can consider them as not conflicting since a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with another starting at the same time T. Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 (one from [14-15] and one from [15-18]).
3. **Comparison to available rooms**: With 2 available rooms, and a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings required, we have enough rooms to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Therefore, the answer is YES, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Explanation:
1. **Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting [12-14] and [13-15] both start before 13 but end after 13, so they overlap.
   - The meeting [13-15] overlaps with itself since there are two of them.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 13:00 to 14:00, three meetings are happening simultaneously ([12-14], [13-14], and one instance of [13-15]).
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are only 2 available rooms.
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the number of available rooms (2), it's not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Therefore, NO, all meetings cannot be scheduled without conflicts given the available rooms.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meeting [15-18] overlaps with none.
   - Meeting [11-12] overlaps with meeting [11-13].
   - Meeting [11-13] also overlaps with meeting [11-12].

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 11, both meetings [11-12] and [11-13] are happening simultaneously.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (3), it might seem solvable at first glance. However, we need to consider that these two overlapping meetings cannot be scheduled in a way that does not conflict with each other because they start and end at the same time intervals. Thus, we need 2 out of the 3 rooms for these simultaneous meetings.

Given the structure where a meeting ending at time T does NOT conflict with a meeting starting at time T, it is feasible to schedule these meetings without conflicts as long as we have enough rooms. Since we do, all three meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, the answer should be **YES**.

   - [11-14] overlaps with [13-16] and [15-18].
   - [13-16] overlaps only with [11-14].

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 14, meetings [13-14] and [11-14] are happening simultaneously (2 meetings).
   - At time 15, meetings [15-16], [15-18], and [11-14] are not happening simultaneously because the meeting ending at 15 does not conflict with the one starting at 15. However, meetings [13-16], [13-14], and [15-18] are happening from time 13 to 15 (3 meetings).

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - Since we have 4 available rooms, the condition `max_simultaneous <= num_rooms` holds true.

However, upon closer inspection, the critical point is at time 15-16 where three meetings are happening simultaneously: [13-16], [13-14], and [15-18]. This exceeds the available rooms of 4 minus the one meeting that ends exactly at 15 (leaving us with only 3 rooms for simultaneous meetings).

Therefore, all meetings cannot be scheduled without conflicts. The answer is NO.

Explanation:
1. **Meetings Overlap**:

   - [14-15] overlaps with [15-18].
   - [14-16] overlaps with [14-15].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:

   - At time 15, all three meetings [14-15], [14-16], and [15-18] overlap (3 meetings).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - Since we have exactly 3 rooms available, the condition `max_simultaneous <= num_rooms` is met, but this does not account for scheduling all overlapping times without conflicts.

However, upon closer inspection, it's clear that having three meetings running simultaneously at time 15 is impossible to avoid. Therefore, although there are enough rooms, the overlap in times makes it impossible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Thus, the answer is NO, as not all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts given the constraints.

Current Strategy Being Used:
To determine if meetings can be scheduled:
1. Check which meetings overlap in time
2. Count the maximum number of meetings happening at the same time
3. If max_simultaneous <= num_rooms: YES (solvable)

Problem: [12-15], [12-13], [10-11], [9-11] | 3 rooms (max_simultaneous=2)
Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 4.0s

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Meetings and Overlaps**:
   - Meeting 1: [9-11]
   - Meeting 2: [10-11] (overlaps with Meeting 1)
   - Meeting 3: [12-15] (no overlap with any meetings)
   - Meeting 4: [12-13] (overlaps with Meeting 3)

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   At time 10 and 11, three meetings are happening simultaneously: [9-11], [10-11], and [12-15]. However, since the meeting ending at 11 does not conflict with a meeting starting at 11 (as per the problem structure), this counts as simultaneous use of rooms.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - Available rooms: 3

Although the maximum number of simultaneous meetings matches the available rooms, we need to consider that not all times have exactly three overlapping meetings (e.g., at time 12 only two are happening). However, at any given time where the number of overlapping meetings reaches its peak, it exceeds the available rooms if those rooms are required simultaneously.

In this case, even though the maximum simultaneous meetings is 3 and we have exactly 3 rooms, the critical point lies in the fact that during certain times (like from 10 to 11), three meetings overlap. Since each room can only be assigned once at any given time, and we have no way of shifting these overlapping meetings to different times without violating their constraints, it's impossible to schedule all meetings simultaneously with just 3 rooms.

Therefore, the answer is NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: The meetings [13-14] and [9-10] do not overlap with each other, but there are two meetings happening between 13:00 and 14:00.
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: At time 13:00 to 14:00, we have two meetings scheduled ([13-14], [13-14]), which is the maximum number of simultaneous meetings.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meetings [9-10] and [9-12] overlap.
   - There are no overlaps between [9-10] or [9-12] with [15-17].

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 3.0s

AI Response:
YES.

Explanation:

1. **Overlap Check**: 
   - Meeting [14-16] starts at 14 and ends at 16.
   - Meetings [10-13] both start between 10 and 13, end between 12 and 15.
     - There are two meetings in this range: [10-13] and another meeting also from 10 to 13. These two meetings overlap.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At any given time between 10 and 16, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 (the first meeting [14-16] starts at 14 and ends at 16, overlapping with only one other meeting from 10 to 13).
   - Specifically:
     - From 10 to 13: Two meetings are happening.
     - From 13 to 14: Only the first meeting [14-16] is ongoing.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) does not exceed the available rooms (3).

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (3), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 4.2s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - [9-12] overlaps with [10-11]
   - [12-14] overlaps with [12-13], [15-17], and [15-17] (two instances)
   - [12-13] overlaps with [12-14]
   - [15-17] and [15-17] overlap with each other and with [12-14]

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: 
   At time 12, the following meetings are happening simultaneously: [9-12], [12-13], [12-14]. This gives us a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - We have determined that at most 3 meetings can happen simultaneously.
   - However, we only have 4 rooms available.
   
Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (4), theoretically, all meetings could be scheduled without conflicts. But this does not consider if there's a better allocation that utilizes the rooms more efficiently.

Upon closer inspection:
- At time 12, we have [9-12], [12-13], and [12-14] happening simultaneously (3 rooms).
- At time 15, we have both instances of [15-17] (2 rooms) and [12-14] (1 room).

This means at some point, we would need to use all 4 rooms. However, the overlap analysis shows that no single time slot requires more than 3 meetings.

Since each meeting can be scheduled without conflicts given the available number of rooms:
**YES**, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

Explanation:

1. **Meetings and Overlaps**:
   - Meeting 1: [9-10]
   - Meeting 2: [9-12] (Overlaps with meeting 1)
   - Meeting 3: [12-15] (Overlaps with meetings 1, 4, and 5)
   - Meeting 4: [12-15] (Same as meeting 3)
   - Meeting 5: [14-17] (Overlaps with meeting 3)

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   At time 12, the following meetings are happening simultaneously:
   - Meeting 2: [9-12]
   - Meeting 3: [12-15]
   - Meeting 4: [12-15]

   Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is **3**.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   Since we have only 3 rooms available and the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) equals the number of available rooms, it means all these three meetings can be accommodated in different rooms. However, for other timeslots where more than 3 meetings overlap (e.g., at time 12), there are not enough rooms to schedule all those meetings.

Thus, while some meetings can be scheduled, others cannot due to the insufficient number of available rooms. Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - [9-10] overlaps with none.
   - [10-12] overlaps with [9-10].
   - [12-13] overlaps with [12-14], and [15-17].
   - [12-14] overlaps with [12-13].
   - [15-17] is alone.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   At time 10, three meetings are happening simultaneously: [9-10], [10-12], and [12-13]. This means the maximum number of meetings occurring at any point in time is 3.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   The maximum simultaneous meetings (3) equals the number of available rooms, but since all three meetings happening simultaneously are not overlapping in their entirety (e.g., [9-10] and [12-14] do not overlap), it seems initially possible. However, considering the exact timeframes:

   - At 10:00, [9-10], [10-12], and [12-13] are happening.
   - By 12:00, [10-12], [12-13], and [12-14] are happening.

   This means at 12:00, we have four meetings overlapping in time (two starting and two ending), but since no meeting can start or end exactly at the same time due to the problem structure rules, this is still a conflict. Thus, with only 3 rooms available, it's impossible to schedule all these meetings without conflicts.

Therefore, the answer is NO.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 5.1s

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - [14-17] and [15-18]: Overlap from 15 to 17.
   - [14-17] and [14-17]: Same meeting, no new overlap.
   - [12-13] and [10-12]: Do not overlap as they start before the first overlapping period ends.
   
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At 15:00 to 17:00, there are two meetings happening simultaneously: [14-17] and [15-18].
   - No other time slots have more than two meetings occurring at the same time.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.
   - There are 3 available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (3), it might seem solvable. However, we need to ensure that all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts at any point in time. 

Let's consider a scheduling approach:
- From 10:00 to 12:00: [10-12] is happening.
- From 12:00 to 13:00: No meeting (but it overlaps with the next interval).
- From 14:00 to 17:00: Both [14-17] and [15-18] are happening simultaneously, requiring 2 rooms.
- From 17:00 onwards: Only one of these meetings will end, but another might start, potentially needing the third room.

Given that at most two rooms would be used continuously from 14:00 to 17:00, and we have three rooms available, it seems solvable. However, the critical point is ensuring no time slot has more than 3 meetings (which isn't possible as only up to 2 do).

Since there are no conflicting overlaps at any specific moment beyond the maximum simultaneous events, and all can fit within the constraints of having 3 rooms available, the answer is indeed **YES**.

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meetings [9-10] and [9-11] overlap.
   - Meetings [13-14] and [13-16] overlap.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 9, meetings [9-10] and [9-11] are happening simultaneously (2 meetings).
   - At times 13 and 14, meetings [13-14] and [13-16] are happening simultaneously (2 meetings).

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.
   - Since we have exactly 2 rooms available, it's possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Therefore, the answer is YES. All meetings can be scheduled without conflicts given the available 2 rooms.

Current Strategy Being Used:
To determine if meetings can be scheduled:
1. Check which meetings overlap in time

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Meetings and Overlaps**:
   - Meeting 1: [11-12]
   - Meeting 2: [10-12] overlaps with Meeting 1 and [11-12]
   - Meeting 3: [11-12] overlaps with Meeting 1
   - Meeting 4: [12-15] starts at the same time as Meeting 1 ends, so it does not conflict but overlaps with Meetings 2 and 3.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 11, all three meetings are happening simultaneously (Meetings 1, 2, and 3).
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Since there are only 2 rooms available and we have a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings, it's not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Thus, the answer is NO.

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Analysis**:
   - Meeting [9-10] overlaps with meeting [11-14].
   - Meeting [11-14] overlaps with both [9-10] and [11-12].
   - Meeting [11-12] starts at the same time as [11-14] ends, so they do not conflict.
   - Meeting [14-17] does not overlap with any other meeting.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 11, meetings [9-10], [11-14], and [11-12] are happening simultaneously. This is the maximum number of simultaneous meetings.
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the available rooms (2).

Therefore, not all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts because there will always be at least three meetings happening at the same time when only two rooms are available.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meeting [13-14] overlaps with both [11-13] and [13-14].
   - Meeting [14-16] does not overlap with any other meeting.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 13, two meetings are happening: [13-14] (two instances) and [11-13]. 
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - There are 4 rooms available.
   - However, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.
   
Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (4), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts according to the given strategy. Therefore, the answer should be "YES" based on the problem structure provided.

However, upon re-evaluating the problem statement and the key insight that a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with a meeting starting at time T, it is clear that there was an error in the initial analysis. The correct maximum number of simultaneous meetings is actually 3 (two instances of [13-14] and one instance of [14-16]), which exceeds the available rooms.

Thus, the correct answer is:
NO

Explanation: 
- At time 13, two meetings are happening: both instances of [13-14].
- At time 14, three meetings are happening: two instances of [13-14] and one instance of [14-16]. 
- The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
- Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the available rooms (4), it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

   - [11-12] and [12-15]: No overlap; they are consecutive.
   - [14-16] has no overlaps with other meetings.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings:**
   - At time 10, both [9-10] and [10-13] are happening simultaneously (2 meetings).
   - At times 11 and 12, only one meeting is occurring at each of these times.
   - At time 14, no meetings overlap.

The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms:**
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (3), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meeting [10-12] overlaps with meeting [11-13] (from 11:00 to 12:00).
   - Meetings do not overlap at the end/start times, as per the problem structure.
   
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 11:00, both meetings [10-12] and [11-13] are happening simultaneously.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - We have 2 rooms available.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is equal to the number of available rooms.
   
Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings equals the number of available rooms, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts under this strategy.

However, since the problem asks specifically for a NO answer based on an error in the initial reasoning:
- The correct maximum simultaneous meetings are 2, and with 2 available rooms, we should technically get a YES. But if we strictly follow the provided strategy's failure condition (max_simultaneous > num_rooms), it incorrectly gives a NO.
   
Corrected Answer: **YES**

Explanation corrected based on actual scheduling feasibility:
- All meetings can be scheduled without conflicts as there are enough rooms for the peak of 2 simultaneous meetings.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 5.0s

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meetings [9-11] and [11-12] overlap at time 11.
   - Meetings [12-15] and [14-17] partially overlap from 14 to 15.
   - Meetings [14-17], [15-18], and [12-15] all have overlapping segments.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 14, we have three meetings starting: [14-17], [15-18], and the part of [12-15].
   - At time 15, we still have two ongoing meetings from previous overlaps plus a new one: [14-17] is ongoing until 17, [15-18] starts at 15.
   
   Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is also 3.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) is equal to the number of available rooms, it seems at first glance that all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts. However, this overlooks a critical point: while no meeting ending at time T conflicts with another starting at T, overlapping segments must still fit within the same room constraints.

Upon closer inspection:
- Meeting [12-15] and [14-17] overlap from 14 to 15.
- Meeting [15-18] overlaps with both [14-17] and [12-15] at time 15.
  
This results in three meetings happening simultaneously, which matches the available rooms but does not account for the exact overlapping segments. Since we have only three rooms and these are required to handle the maximum overlap of three meetings starting or ending around 14:00 to 18:00, it's indeed possible to schedule all meetings.

Therefore, the correct answer is **YES**; all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts given the available rooms.

1. Check which meetings overlap in time

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 4.3s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - [9-10] and [11-14] do not overlap.
   - [13-15] overlaps with neither of the other meetings at any point in time, as it starts after [9-10] ends and finishes before [11-14] starts.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 11:00, both [9-10] has ended but [11-14] is just starting.
   - At time 13:00, the meeting [13-15] is about to start and will run until 15:00.
   - This means that at any point in time (11:00 or 13:00), there are two meetings happening simultaneously.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, which is equal to the number of available rooms.
   - Since we have exactly enough rooms to accommodate these overlapping times (no more than 2 meetings at any time), the scheduling is feasible with all three rooms utilized.

However, upon re-evaluation based on the given strategy and insight:
- The strategy states that if max_simultaneous <= num_rooms: YES; otherwise, NO.
- Here, max_simultaneous = 2 (which is exactly equal to the number of available rooms), but since we are looking for strict inequality (max_simultaneous < num_rooms) to determine solvability under this specific strategy.

Given that the maximum simultaneous meetings (2) equals the number of rooms (3), and following the given strategy, the answer remains **NO**, as the condition max_simultaneous <= num_rooms only indicates feasibility with exact room equality but does not strictly allow for the possibility when there are more rooms than needed to prevent conflicts.

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - [9-11] overlaps with [11-12]
   - [13-16] overlaps with [13-14]

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 11, both [9-11] and [11-12] are happening simultaneously (2 meetings).
   - At time 13, both [13-16] and [13-14] are happening simultaneously (2 meetings).

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.
   - Available rooms: 3.

While the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, which is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (3), we must also consider that at some points in time, three meetings could potentially be scheduled if they don't overlap. However, since [9-11] and [11-12] overlap for one hour, and similarly for [13-16] and [13-14], only 2 rooms are needed simultaneously at their peak.

Therefore, all meetings cannot be scheduled without conflicts because we need to ensure that no more than 3 meetings happen simultaneously. However, since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is only 2, it means there's enough room (as per our strategy) but not a perfect fit due to overlapping constraints at specific times. Thus, the answer remains NO based on the strict conditions provided.

Corrected Answer: NO. The overlap between [9-11] and [11-12], and [13-16] and [13-14], means that even though we have 3 rooms, we can't schedule all meetings without conflicts due to overlapping times.

   - Meeting [12-13] and Meeting [13-15] overlap from 13:00 to 13:15.
   - There are no overlaps between the other meetings.
   
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At 13:00, both Meetings [12-13] and [13-15] start simultaneously (overlap).
   - At 14:00, Meeting [14-16] starts while Meeting [13-15] is still ongoing.
   
   Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is **2**.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (3).

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings does not exceed the number of available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Current Strategy Being Used:
To determine if meetings can be scheduled:
1. Check which meetings overlap in time
2. Count the maximum number of meetings happening at the same time
3. If max_simultaneous <= num_rooms: YES (solvable)
4. If max_simultaneous > num_rooms: NO (impossible)

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 6.0s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - The meeting [14-16] overlaps with both the meetings [14-17] and [10-13].
   - The meeting [14-17] only overlaps with [14-16] as it starts at 14 and ends at 17.
   - The meeting [10-13] does not overlap with any other meetings, but it is scheduled before the overlapping period of [14-16] and [14-17].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 14: Both [14-16] and [14-17] are starting.
   - At time 15: All three meetings [10-13], [14-16], and [14-17] are happening simultaneously (as they all start before or at this time).
   - At time 16: Meetings [14-16] and [14-17] are still ongoing.
   - At time 13: Meeting [10-13] ends, but [14-16] and [14-17] continue.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is three at any given point in time (from 15 to 16).
   - Since the available rooms are exactly three, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts if they can be allocated properly during their respective times.

However, despite having enough room availability, the scheduling strategy must ensure that no two overlapping meetings are assigned to the same room. Given the overlap from 14-17, this requires careful allocation:

- At 15: Allocate rooms for [10-13], [14-16], and [14-17].
- At 16: Reallocate as needed since [14-16] ends, but [14-17] continues.

Given the constraints, while there are enough rooms to accommodate all meetings simultaneously at their peak overlap times, proper temporal proximity management is required. In this case, the strategy would need to ensure that overlapping meetings are assigned to different rooms without conflict. Since no preference or priority rules are given and all strategies (like greedy scheduling) must handle these overlaps efficiently:

The answer remains NO because the overlapping nature of [14-16] and [14-17] at 15-16 would require simultaneous allocation, which is not explicitly allowed by default in this problem structure without further temporal proximity management.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**
   - Meeting 1: [12-15]
   - Meeting 2: [15-16]
   - These two meetings overlap between the time slots 15 and 16.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**
   - In this case, there are no conflicting intervals that prevent scheduling.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 1 since only one meeting can be happening at any given time slot due to the non-overlapping nature of the intervals (ignoring the brief overlap which does not create a conflict as per the problem constraints).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   - Since there is only one meeting happening at any given time, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Given that we have enough rooms and no conflicting intervals (ignoring the brief overlap), all meetings can indeed be scheduled without issues.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - Meeting [10-12] and [11-13] partially overlap (from 11 to 12).
   - Meeting [13-16] and [15-18] do not overlap.
   
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - At any given time, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3:
     - From 10 to 11, only meeting [10-12] occurs.
     - From 11 to 12, both meetings [10-12] and [11-13] occur (overlap).
     - From 12 to 13, only meeting [11-13] occurs.
     - From 13 to 16, three meetings ([13-16], [15-18], [10-12]) do not overlap in the same time slot (as [10-12] ends by 12).
     - From 15 to 18, only meeting [15-18] occurs.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   - At peak times, there can be up to 3 meetings occurring simultaneously (from 13 to 16).

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3 and we have exactly 3 available rooms, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - Meeting [10-13] overlaps with meeting [12-15] since there is a common time interval from 12:00 to 13:00.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings in the given schedule is 2, as only two meetings are present and they share an overlapping time interval.
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - With 3 available rooms and a need for at least 2 rooms to accommodate both meetings (since there is overlap), we have enough room availability.

Given that we have more rooms than the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

AI Response:
YES.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [14-15]
   - Meeting 2: [11-14] (No conflict with other meetings)
   - Meeting 3: [14-17]
   - Meeting 4: [13-15]

   Specifically, we can see the following overlaps:
   - Meeting 1 and Meeting 3 both start at 14:00.
   - Meeting 2 does not overlap with any other meetings.
   - Meeting 4 overlaps partially with Meetings 1 and 3 (from 13:00 to 15:00).

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   At time 14:00, three meetings are happening simultaneously: [14-15], [14-17], and part of [13-15]. However, since Meeting 2 ends at 14:00, it does not conflict with the others starting at 14:00.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - With two rooms available, we can schedule up to two meetings simultaneously.
   - Given that the maximum simultaneous overlap is three meetings (but only for a brief period), and knowing that [11-14] does not overlap with any others, it’s feasible to allocate rooms as follows:

     - Room 1: [13-15]
     - Room 2: [14-17]

   This allocation ensures no conflicts. Room 1 can handle Meetings 3 and 4, while Room 2 handles Meeting 1. Since [11-14] does not overlap with any other meeting starting before 11:00 or ending after 15:00, it can be scheduled in either room without conflict.

Thus, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts using the available two rooms.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - Meeting [10-11] overlaps with meeting [10-11].
   - Meeting [14-16] does not overlap with the others.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 (meetings [10-11] and [14-16]).
   - Meeting [14-16] can be scheduled without conflict as it starts after both [10-11] meetings have ended.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - The maximum simultaneous meetings (2) matches the number of available rooms.

Since we have exactly enough rooms to accommodate the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the strategies outlined.

AI Response:
YES.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - Meeting [12-15] overlaps with [12-14], [14-17].
   - Meeting [15-16] does not overlap with any other meetings.
   - Meeting [14-17] overlaps with [12-14], [12-15].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - At time 14, there are three overlapping meetings: [12-14], [12-15], and [14-17].
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - Since we have 2 available rooms but need at least 3 rooms to accommodate all the overlapping meetings simultaneously, it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.
   
However, based on the given information and strategies, we can attempt to minimize conflicts by allocating rooms as follows:

- Allocate room 1 for [12-15], [12-14], and [14-17] (occupying two rooms at most due to overlap).
- Allocate room 2 for [15-16].

Thus, while the initial check indicates that we cannot fully avoid conflicts with just 2 rooms, this allocation strategy helps in minimizing them. Therefore, the answer is YES, but it's important to note that one of the meetings will still have a conflict.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - Meeting 1: [14-17]
   - Meeting 2: [12-14]

   There is an overlap between these two meetings from time 14 to 14 (inclusive). This means both meetings need the room simultaneously at some point during this period.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At any given time, only one meeting can be scheduled in a room.
   - From time 14 to 17, we have two meetings: [14-17] and [12-14], which overlap from 14 to 14.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 2 available rooms.
   - To accommodate the overlapping period (14-17), both meetings require a room simultaneously, so we need 2 rooms for this time slot.

Since there are 2 available rooms and only 2 simultaneous meetings at their overlap times, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Time: 5.8s

AI Response:
**NO**

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - Meeting 1: [10-13]
   - Meeting 2: [14-15]
   - Meeting 3: [15-16]
   - Meeting 4: [15-17]

   Meetings [15-16] and [15-17] overlap because they start at the same time (15) but end at different times.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   To determine the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, we need to identify the peak time where multiple meetings are occurring:
   - At 10:00, only Meeting 1 starts.
   - From 10:00 to 13:00, only Meeting 1 is in progress.
   - At 13:00, Meeting 1 ends.
   - At 14:00, Meeting 2 starts.
   - At 15:00, both Meetings 2 and 3 start (overlap).
   - From 15:00 to 16:00, Meetings 2 and 3 are in progress.
   - At 16:00, Meeting 3 ends.
   - At 16:00 to 17:00, only Meeting 4 is in progress.

   The maximum number of simultaneous meetings at any given time is **2** (Meetings 2 and 3 from 15:00 to 16:00).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need to be scheduled is 2.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) matches the number of available rooms, it might seem like all meetings could potentially be scheduled without conflicts if they can be properly partitioned and allocated. However, we still have to consider the overlapping interval [15-16] where both Meetings 3 and 4 need to share a room.

Given that only one room is needed for each of these overlapping times (15:00 to 16:00), but they cannot be simultaneously allocated in different rooms due to their overlap, this creates a conflict. Therefore, it's not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts under the given constraints and available resources.

Thus, the answer is **NO**.

   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings in this case is 2, as two meetings are happening at the exact same time (13:00).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 2 available rooms.
   - Since we can schedule both overlapping meetings by assigning them to different rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 7.7s

AI Response:
NO.

### Explanation:

#### 1. Overlapping Meetings
- [11-13] and [12-13]: These meetings partially overlap.
- [13-16], [13-15], and [14-16]: These meetings all start at or before time 13, creating multiple overlapping intervals:
  - From 13 to 15: [13-15] overlaps with both [13-16] and [14-16].
  - From 15 to 16: [15-18] partially overlaps with [14-16], but the exact overlap is between 15 and 16.

#### 2. Maximum Simultaneous Meetings
- At time 13, three meetings start simultaneously: [11-13], [12-13], and [13-16].
- From 14 to 15, four meetings are happening:
  - [13-15] (ends at 15)
  - [14-16]
  - [15-18] starts but only conflicts from 15 to 16.
  
Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is **4**.

#### 3. Comparison to Available Rooms
- We have 4 available rooms.
- The peak demand for room usage is 4 simultaneous meetings.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (4) matches the number of available rooms, it seems at first glance that we might be able to schedule all meetings without conflicts. However, we need to check the exact overlaps and ensure no time slot requires more than one room.

### Detailed Schedule Check
- At 13:00 - 15:00, four meetings ([11-13], [12-13], [13-16], and [13-15]) are happening. This is a critical point where we need to ensure no overlap beyond the two rooms available.
- From 15:00 - 16:00, three meetings ([13-15], [14-16], and [15-18]) are overlapping. However, [15-18] only overlaps partially from 15 to 16.

Given the constraints:
- Rooms 1 and 2 can handle [11-13] and [13-15].
- Room 3 handles [12-13].
- Room 4 handles [14-16].

This schedule works, but if you consider a more detailed partitioning of time intervals:
- From 13:00 - 15:00, use two rooms (e.g., Rooms 1 and 2 for the first three meetings).
- At 15:00 - 16:00, ensure only one room is needed as [14-16] starts after the critical overlap period.

Therefore, with careful partitioning, it can be managed without conflicts. However, based on the given strategies and constraints, the initial check indicates that all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts using 4 rooms efficiently.

### Final Answer
YES

The strategy of dynamic partitioning and handling overlaps correctly ensures all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts given the available resources.

AI Response:
**Answer:** NO

**Explanation:**

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - Meeting [15-16] overlaps with [15-18].
   - Meeting [15-18] also overlaps with [12-15].
   - Meeting [11-14] and [12-15] overlap.
   
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - At time 15, meetings [15-16], [15-18], and [12-15] are occurring simultaneously. This means there is a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings at this time.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   - The scenario allows for up to 3 simultaneous meetings, which matches the number of available rooms exactly.

However, the challenge lies in ensuring that all overlapping meetings can be scheduled without conflicts across different rooms. Given the overlaps:
- At time 15, three meetings need to be scheduled: [15-16], [15-18], and [12-15]. This means we would need to allocate one room for each of these overlapping intervals.

Since all overlapping intervals cannot be accommodated in separate rooms without conflict (as they share the same time slots), it is impossible to schedule all meetings without conflicts under the given constraints. Therefore, the answer is NO.

YES.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [12-14]
   - Meeting 2: [11-14]
   - Meeting 3: [12-14]

   Both meetings 1, 3 and meeting 2, 3 overlap with each other. Specifically:
   - Meetings 1 and 3 overlap from time 12 to 14.
   - Meetings 2 and 3 overlap from time 12 to 14.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   At any given time within the overlapping periods, there are at most two meetings happening simultaneously (e.g., from 12:00 to 14:00, both meeting 1 and meeting 3 overlap).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous overlapping meetings is 2.

Since the number of available rooms (2) matches the maximum number of simultaneous overlapping meetings (2), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts by assigning one room for each pair of overlapping meetings. For example, meeting 1 and meeting 3 can use Room 1 from 12:00 to 14:00, while meeting 2 and meeting 3 can use Room 2 from 11:00 to 14:00.

Thus, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

AI Response:
**NO**

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**
   - Meeting [15-17] overlaps with [12-15], [14-15], and [15-18].
   - Meeting [12-15] overlaps with [15-17].
   - Meeting [14-15] overlaps with [15-17] and [15-18].
   - Meeting [15-18] overlaps with [15-17].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**
   - At time 15, the following meetings are happening: [15-17], [14-15], [15-18].
   - Therefore, there are up to three simultaneous meetings at certain times.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**
   - There are only two available rooms.
   - With three simultaneous meetings requiring a room each time 15 is fully occupied, it's impossible to allocate all required rooms simultaneously.

Given the constraints and the overlap of meetings, it's not possible to schedule all four meetings without conflicts when only two rooms are available.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - The meeting from 11-13 overlaps with the meeting from 12-13 because their time ranges intersect.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At any given time, there can be a maximum of two meetings happening simultaneously (11-13 and 12-13 overlap).

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 and we have 3 available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

With three rooms available, one room will remain unused while the other two handle the overlapping schedule from 11 to 13.

   There is no overlap between these two meeting time ranges. Meeting 1 starts at 15 and ends at 17, while Meeting 2 starts at 13 and ends at 16.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   Since there are no overlapping intervals, both meetings can be scheduled simultaneously without any conflicts. The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**: 
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   - We need to schedule 2 meetings.

Given that we have more than enough rooms (3) to accommodate the 2 meetings, all meetings can be scheduled without any conflicts.

AI Response:
NO.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**
   - Meeting [9-11] overlaps with meeting [10-12] (which appears twice).
   - Meeting [15-18] does not overlap with any other meetings.
   - Meetings [10-12], [10-12], and [12-14] all start at 10:00, overlapping each other.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**
   - At 10:00 to 11:00, we have three simultaneous meetings: [9-11], [10-12], and another [10-12].
   - At 12:00 to 14:00, two overlapping meetings are present: [12-14] and [11-14].

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (three) exceeds the available rooms (four).
   - However, even if we could fit three meetings simultaneously in different rooms, there would still be a conflict between the two [10-12] meetings and another meeting at 11:00 to 14:00.

Given these points, it's not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts. The overlap at 10:00 to 11:00 is particularly problematic as it involves three overlapping meetings in a scenario where only four rooms are available.

Time: 2.5s

AI Response:
YES.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting [15-17] and [10-13] do not overlap.
   - Meeting [10-13] overlaps with meeting [12-15], as they share the time slot from 12 to 13.
   - Meeting [13-14] does not overlap with any other meetings in this set.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 12, we have two overlapping meetings: [10-13] and [12-15].
   - At time 13, we still have the same two overlapping meetings.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 2 available rooms.
   - The maximum simultaneous overlap is 2, which matches the number of available rooms.

Since we can schedule up to 2 simultaneous meetings with the available rooms and there are no more than 2 overlapping meetings at any time, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

AI Response:
YES.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - [9-10]: No overlaps.
   - [14-16]: No overlaps with others in the given time slots.
   - [10-12]: Overlaps with:
     - [10-11]
     - [11-13] (ends at 13, but overlaps from 11 to 12)
     - [11-12]
   - [10-11]: Overlaps with:
     - [11-13] (starts before and ends after this meeting)
     - [11-12]
   - [11-13]: Overlaps with:
     - [11-12]
     - [10-12]
   - [11-12]: No additional overlaps beyond those already mentioned.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   At 11, multiple meetings start or end:
   - [9-10] ends.
   - [10-11] ends.
   - [11-13] starts.
   - [11-12] starts.

   This means up to 3 meetings can occur simultaneously at any point in time (from 10:59 to 11:01).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   With the maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings, and given that we have 4 available rooms:
   - We can allocate a separate room for each meeting during their peak overlap times.

### Conclusion:
Given that there are no more than 3 overlapping meetings at any time, and we have 4 available rooms, it is feasible to schedule all the meetings without conflicts. Each set of simultaneous meetings (up to three) can be allocated to different rooms, ensuring no overlaps occur.

Time: 4.9s

AI Response:
YES.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - [11-13] overlaps with both [11-13] and [11-12].
   - [11-13] overlaps with [11-12].
   - [12-13] does not overlap with any other meeting except for a shared interval with [11-13].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - At 11, there are 3 meetings starting ([11-13], [11-13], and [11-12]).
   - At 12, there are 4 simultaneous meetings ([11-13] (end), [11-12] (end), [12-13] (start)).
   - At 13, there are 2 meetings ending ([11-13], [11-13]).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings at any time is 4.
   - With 3 available rooms, we can accommodate all the necessary room allocations without conflicts.

Given that the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (4) exceeds the number of available rooms (3), it initially appears there might be an issue. However, upon closer inspection:

- The overlap at 12 is only a shared interval between [11-13] and [12-13], meaning they can share a room without conflict.
- At 11, three meetings are starting simultaneously but can be assigned to three different rooms.

Thus, the allocation can look like this:
- Room 1: [11-13]
- Room 2: [11-13]
- Room 3: [11-12]

And at 12:
- Room 1: Continues from [11-13] to [12-13]
- Room 2: Continues from [11-13] to [12-13]
- Room 3: Ends, no new meeting starts

This shows that all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts using the available rooms.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - [9-10] overlaps with [9-11], [9-12], and [10-11]
   - [9-11] overlaps with [9-12] and [10-11]
   - [10-11] overlaps with [10-13] and [9-10]
   - No other overlaps exist.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - At time 10, meetings [9-10], [9-11], [9-12], and [10-11] are occurring simultaneously.
   - This results in a maximum of 4 simultaneous meetings.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - There are 4 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (4) matches the number of available rooms exactly.

Since we have enough rooms to accommodate all the overlapping meetings, it is possible to schedule all the given meetings without conflicts.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meeting [10-11] and [12-15] do not overlap as they are scheduled at different time slots.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At any given time, there is only one meeting happening (either 10-11 or 12-15).
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 1.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - With 2 available rooms and a maximum of 1 simultaneous meeting, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.
   - Meeting [10-11] can use one room, and Meeting [12-15] can use the other room.

Since there are no overlapping times and we have enough rooms to accommodate each meeting in turn, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without any conflicts.

Time: 3.7s

AI Response:
**NO**

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - Meeting [10-12] and [10-13] both start at 10, but [10-13] ends later.
   - Meeting [10-12] overlaps with [14-16] and [15-17].
   - Meeting [14-16] does not overlap with any other meetings within the given time intervals.
   - Meeting [15-17] starts after [14-16] ends, so it doesn't conflict directly but overlaps indirectly through [10-13].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - Between 10 and 12, we have meetings [10-12] and [10-13], which overlap.
   - At any given time between 15 and 17, there are two overlapping meetings: [15-17] and [14-16].

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings occurring at the same time is 2 (from 10 to 12).
   - With 4 available rooms, we can potentially schedule all these overlapping meetings without conflicts if managed correctly.

However, since [10-13] starts earlier than [14-16], and both need room assignments simultaneously from 10 to 12, it means that even with 4 rooms, you cannot avoid having two overlapping meetings in the same time slot. Therefore, scheduling all these meetings without conflicts is not possible.

Thus, the answer is **NO**.

Time: 4.9s

AI Response:
NO.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**
   - [14-15] and [15-16] overlap.
   - [11-12], [13-14], and [14-16] all start at or before 14, and some of them continue beyond 14. Specifically:
     - [11-14] overlaps with [14-15].
     - [14-15] and [14-16] overlap.
   - The overlaps are summarized as follows:
     - [11-12], [13-14]
     - [14-15], [15-16]
     - [14-15], [14-16]

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings that can occur is 3.
   - Consider the time range [14-15]: Meetings at this time are [14-15], [14-16], and [13-14].
   - Another overlapping set during [14-15] to [14-16] is: [14-15], [14-16].

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**
   - We have 4 available rooms.
   - With the maximum simultaneous meetings being 3, and we have 4 rooms available, it seems that room allocation should be feasible in theory.

However, upon closer inspection:
- During the time range [14-15], three meetings are happening: [14-15], [14-16], and [13-14].
- Meeting [14-15] is also overlapping with meeting [11-14].
- The interval [11-12] overlaps with [11-14].

Given these overlaps, we can only allocate 3 meetings at any given time. Therefore, although there are enough rooms to accommodate the maximum simultaneous meetings (3), the specific overlaps and scheduling constraints mean that all meetings cannot be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, the answer is NO; not all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts due to overlapping time ranges.

AI Response:
**YES**

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - [10-11] and [14-16] do not overlap.
   - [13-16] overlaps with both [14-16] and [15-18].
   - [15-18] starts where [13-16] ends, so they do not conflict.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - At time 14, we have two meetings starting simultaneously: [10-11], [13-16].
   - At time 15, only one meeting is ongoing: [13-16] (as [10-11] has ended).
   - Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - We have 4 available rooms.
   - The maximum simultaneous meetings required are 2.

Since we have more than enough rooms to accommodate the maximum simultaneous meetings (4 > 2), it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Therefore, **YES**, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - [11-14] and [12-15] overlap because they share the time range from 12:00 to 14:00.
   - [11-12] does not overlap with any other meetings.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At 12:00, two meetings start ([11-14] and [12-15]).
   - At 14:00, one meeting ends ([11-14]) and another starts ([12-15]).
   - Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 at any point in time.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The system needs to accommodate two simultaneous meetings.
   - There are only 2 available rooms.
   
Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) matches the number of available rooms and all overlapping issues can be managed by assigning different rooms for overlapping times, it is feasible to schedule these meetings without conflicts. However, based on the provided structure where meetings ending at a time do not conflict with those starting at the same time, no specific room constraints arise from overlaps.

Given that both conditions (maximum simultaneous meetings and available rooms) align, the answer remains:
YES.

All meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the two available rooms.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:** 
   - Meeting 1: [9-11]
   - Meeting 2: [15-17]
   
   There is no overlap between the two meetings as they are scheduled at different time intervals.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings in this case is 2, since only one meeting (9-11) or another (15-17) can be happening at any given time.
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - We have 3 available rooms but need to schedule only 2 meetings.
   - Since there are no overlapping meetings and the number of available rooms exceeds the number of required rooms, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, with 3 available rooms and no overlap between the two meetings, all meetings can be scheduled successfully.

### Explanation:

1. **Overlap Check**:
   - Meeting [12-14] starts at 12 and ends at 14.
   - Meeting [14-16] starts at 14 and ends at 16.
   - These meetings overlap between the times 14:00 to 14:59, as they share a common time period.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings during this interval is 1 because although both meetings share some overlapping time (14-16), they are not simultaneously in the room at exactly the same time.
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - Since only one meeting can be in a room at any given time and there is an overlap, both meetings can be scheduled without conflict by using two different rooms.

Thus, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts by utilizing the two available rooms.

Time: 4.5s

AI Response:
YES.

### Analysis:

1. **Identifying Overlapping Meetings:**
   - [12-13] and [12-14]: No overlap.
   - [12-13] and [14-17]: No overlap.
   - [12-13] and [14-16]: No overlap.
   - [12-13] and [15-17]: Overlap from 12 to 13 (1 hour).
   - [12-14] and [14-17]: Overlap from 14 to 17 (3 hours).
   - [12-14] and [14-16]: Overlap from 14 to 14 (0 overlap, but consecutive).
   - [12-14] and [15-17]: Overlap from 12 to 14 (2 hours).
   - [14-17] and [15-17]: Overlap from 14 to 17 (3 hours).

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - From the overlaps identified, we see that up to 3 meetings can occur simultaneously:
     - At 14-16: [14-16], [15-17]
     - At 14-17: [14-17], [12-14]
     - At 15-17: [15-17], [14-17]

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3, and we have 2 available rooms.
   - Therefore, it's possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts by using the two rooms efficiently.

### Conclusion:
All meetings can be scheduled without conflicts because even during peak overlap times (14-17), only 3 meetings occur, which can be managed with 2 rooms if they are allocated appropriately.

Problem: [11-13], [15-16], [15-16], [11-13], [10-12], [13-16] | 4 rooms (max_simultaneous=3)
Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 3.5s

AI Response:
**YES**

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - [11-13] and [15-16] do not overlap.
   - The two occurrences of [15-16] do not overlap with each other; they can be scheduled in the same room at different times.
   - [10-12], [11-13], and [13-16] all contain overlapping segments. Specifically, both [11-13] and [13-16] are present during the time period from 11 to 13.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - From the given meetings, we can see that there is a maximum of three simultaneous meetings possible:
     - One meeting in the range [10-12].
     - Two meetings overlapping in the range [11-13]: one from [11-13] and another part of [13-16].
     - Another two meetings overlapping in the range [15-16].

   Thus, at most three rooms are needed to accommodate these overlapping times.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - There are 4 available rooms.
   - Since we need only up to 3 rooms for simultaneous scheduling (as explained above), and there are 4 available rooms, it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Given that the maximum number of required rooms (3) is less than or equal to the available rooms (4), **YES**, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Problem: [11-12], [12-14] | 3 rooms (max_simultaneous=1)
Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 2.5s

AI Response:
YES.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - Meeting [11-12] and [12-14] overlap at time 12:00.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - There is only one meeting, [11-12], that can run concurrently with the start of another meeting, [12-14]. However, since a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with a meeting starting at time T, there are no conflicts here.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - With 3 available rooms and only one overlapping interval (from 12:00 to 14:00), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts by simply assigning different rooms for the overlapping period. For example:
     - [11-12] in Room 1
     - [12-14] in Room 2 and Room 3 (since it starts at 12:00, both Room 2 and Room 3 can be used simultaneously).

Thus, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Problem: [10-12], [15-17], [11-13] | 3 rooms (max_simultaneous=2)
Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 3.4s

AI Response:
YES.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - Meeting 1: [10-12]
   - Meeting 2: [15-17]
   - Meeting 3: [11-13]

   The only overlap is between Meeting 1 and Meeting 3, as they both occupy the time range [11-12]. However, since a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with a meeting starting at time T, there is no actual conflict here.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - At any given time, we can only have up to 2 meetings happening simultaneously:
     - From 10-11: Only Meeting 1.
     - From 11-12: Both Meeting 1 and Meeting 3 are present but non-overlapping in terms of conflict rules.
     - From 12-13: Only Meeting 3.
     - From 13-15: No meetings.
     - From 15-17: Only Meeting 2.

   Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 (Meeting 1 and Meeting 3 at 11-12).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - We have a total of 3 rooms available.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need rooms is 2.

Since we have more available rooms than the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, the answer is YES.

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 4.2s

AI Response:
**YES**

### Explanation:

#### 1. Which Meetings Overlap
- **[9-12]** overlaps with: [10-11], [10-13]
- **[10-11]** overlaps with: [9-12], [11-14]
- **[10-13]** overlaps with: [9-12], [12-14]
- **[11-14]** overlaps with: [10-11], [12-14], [13-14]

#### 2. Maximum Simultaneous Meetings
To determine the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, we need to identify the peak time where the most overlapping intervals occur.

- **9-12**: Overlaps with [10-11] and [10-13]
- **10-11**: Overlaps with [9-12], [10-13], and [11-14]
- **10-13**: Overlaps with [9-12], [11-14]
- **11-14**: Overlaps with [10-11], [12-14], [13-14]

The peak overlap occurs between 10:00 and 11:00, where three meetings are happening simultaneously:
- [9-12]
- [10-11] (starting at 10)
- [10-13]

#### 3. Comparison to Available Rooms
The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3, which falls within the available rooms (4). Since we have more than enough rooms (4) to accommodate up to 3 simultaneous meetings, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, **YES**, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

AI Response:
YES.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - Meeting 1: [14-17]
   - Meeting 2: [12-14]
   
   These two meetings do not overlap. Meeting 1 starts at 14 and ends at 17, while Meeting 2 starts at 12 and ends at 14.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   Since the given meetings do not overlap (Meeting 1 does not start until after Meeting 2 has ended), we can schedule them simultaneously without any conflict.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   - We only have 2 meetings that need scheduling.

Since there are more available rooms than the number of meetings, and the meetings do not overlap, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 3.5s

AI Response:
YES

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - Meeting [11-12] overlaps with [10-12] because both start between 10 and 12.
   - Meeting [12-15] starts at 12 but does not overlap with [11-12], as it begins after the end of [11-12].
   - Meeting [14-17] overlaps with no other meetings because there is a gap between [12-15] and [14-17].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - At time 12, three meetings are happening simultaneously: [10-12], [11-12], and [12-15].
   - However, only two rooms are available.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - With the maximum of three simultaneous meetings requiring up to three rooms, but with only two rooms available, we need to find a way to schedule these meetings without conflicts.
   - We can use dynamic partitioning and advanced overlap handling logic to determine that it is possible to schedule all meetings.

Given the constraints:
- Schedule [10-12] in one room.
- Schedule [11-12] in another room, which does not conflict as they start at the same time but end differently.
- Schedule [14-17] in a third potential room if available or merge it with other schedules to fit within the two rooms.

Thus, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the strategies outlined.

AI Response:
**NO**

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - Meeting 1: [13-16]
   - Meeting 2: [11-13] overlaps with Meeting 4: [11-13]
   - Meeting 3: [14-17] overlaps with Meeting 5: [14-16], and partially overlaps with Meeting 1: [13-16]

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - At time 13, we have three meetings starting or ending: [13-16], [11-13] (ending), and [14-17] starting.
   - At time 14, we have two overlapping meetings: [14-17], [14-16].
   - At time 15, Meeting 3 is ongoing from 14 to 17.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the available rooms (3).

Therefore, with only 3 rooms available and up to 3 simultaneous meetings required at certain times, it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Problem: [11-13], [10-11] | 3 rooms (max_simultaneous=1)
Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 2.2s

AI Response:
**NO**

Explanation:

1. **Overlap Detection:**
   - The meeting from 10-11 overlaps with the meeting from 11-13, as they share the time slot of 11.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - At time 11, both meetings are happening simultaneously (meeting [10-11] and meeting [11-13]).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - With only one simultaneous meeting at the peak time (11), you can accommodate this with a single room. However, since there are three rooms available, it is feasible to allocate separate rooms for each of these overlapping meetings if needed.
   
Given that there is an overlap and two meetings need to be scheduled during the same time slot but potentially in different rooms, all required resources (in this case, 2 out of 3 available rooms) can indeed be utilized without conflict. Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap:** 
   - Meeting [11-12] and [14-17] do not overlap as there is a gap between 12 and 14.
   
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings:**
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings in the given schedule is 1, since only one meeting can be happening at any given time.

3. **Comparison to available rooms:**
   - Since we have 2 available rooms and there are no overlapping meetings (only one meeting occurs at a time), all two rooms can be utilized without conflict.
   
Therefore, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the two available rooms.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:** 
   - Meeting [10-11] and Meeting [14-16] do not overlap because they occur at different time intervals.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - In this scenario, there are two distinct meetings occurring at different times (10-11 and 14-16), so the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 1.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - With 2 available rooms and only 1 meeting happening at a time, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts. Each room can be used sequentially for each meeting, ensuring no overlaps and full utilization of the resources.

Therefore, yes, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the available rooms.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [14-17]
   - Meeting 2: [15-18]
   - These two meetings do overlap, as both start after 14 and continue until at least 17 (Meeting 1) or 18 (Meeting 2).

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings based on the given time ranges is 2.
   - Specifically, from 15 to 17, both meetings are happening concurrently.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   - Since only up to 2 meetings can occur simultaneously, and we have 3 rooms available, it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts by allocating one room for the meeting from 14-17 and another room for the overlapping period of the meeting from 15-18.

By using two out of the three available rooms (one for each concurrent meeting), we can successfully allocate the required resources. Therefore, yes, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Expected: NO | Got: YES | ✗
Time: 2.5s

AI Response:
YES.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - Meetings [11-12] and [11-12] (repeated): These two meetings are the same, so they do not overlap.
   - Meeting [15-16]: This meeting overlaps with none of the others since it starts at 15.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - There can be up to three simultaneous meetings from the given schedule:
     - One meeting in the range [11-12]
     - Another meeting in the same range [11-12] (since they are identical)
     - A separate meeting in the range [15-16]

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is three, but since there are only two available rooms, this is feasible.

Thus, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts by allocating one room for each of the overlapping meetings from 11 to 12 and a separate room for the meeting from 15 to 16.

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 3.7s

AI Response:
**YES**

### Explanation:

#### Overlapping Meetings
- **[9-10]** and **[9-10]**: These are the same meeting, so they do not cause an overlap issue.
- **[9-10]** and **[10-12]**: These meetings overlap from 10 to 10 (end of [9-10] and start of [10-12]).
- **[13-15]**, **[14-15]**, and **[14-16]**:
  - **[13-15]** and **[14-15]**: These meetings overlap from 14 to 15.
  - **[14-15]** and **[14-16]**: These meetings overlap from 14 to 15.

#### Maximum Simultaneous Meetings
To find the maximum number of simultaneous meetings:
- At time 10, there are two overlapping meetings: [9-10] and [10-12].
- At times 13, 14, and 15, there are three overlapping meetings: [13-15], [14-15], and [14-16].

The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is **3**.

#### Comparison to Available Rooms
Given that we have 4 available rooms:
- We can schedule the maximum 3 simultaneous meetings using 3 out of the 4 rooms.
- This leaves us with 1 additional room, which means all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, it is possible to schedule all these meetings without any conflicts.

Explanation:

1. **Overlap Detection:** Both meetings have the same time range [12-14], indicating they are overlapping.
   
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:** Since both meetings occur during the exact same time period, there is only one simultaneous meeting at any given time within this interval. Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 1.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:** With 3 available rooms and only 1 meeting occurring simultaneously, it is possible to allocate all required resources without conflicts. Each room can be used to host a different instance of the overlapping meeting if needed, but in this case, we only need one room for the entire time period.

Thus, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the available rooms.

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Check:** 
   - The first meeting is from 9-11 and the second meeting is from 15-17. These two intervals do not overlap as there is a gap between them (11-15).

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - Since the meetings are non-overlapping, only one room is needed at any given time. The maximum number of simultaneous meetings in this case is 1.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - With 2 available rooms and only 1 meeting requiring a room at any given time, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, with the given constraints, it is possible to schedule all meetings without any room conflicts.

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 4.1s

AI Response:
YES.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - [9-10] overlaps with [9-12].
   - [9-12] also includes the overlapping period of [9-10].
   - [12-14] does not overlap with any other meetings.
   - [14-17] starts after all earlier meetings have ended.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - At time 9, we can see three simultaneous meetings: [9-10], [9-12], and [12-14]. Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the available rooms (2), it's clear that we can't schedule all these meetings without conflicts.

However, since the problem structure states that a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with a meeting starting at time T, and considering the specific intervals provided:

- We can allocate [9-10] to one room.
- For the overlapping period from 9 to 12, we need to find another solution. Since [12-14] starts after 12, it doesn't overlap with any meeting starting at or before 12. Thus, we can schedule:
  - [9-10] in one room.
  - [9-12] (including the overlapping part) in another room.
  - [12-14] and [14-17] to these rooms without conflicts.

Since both meetings [9-10] and [9-12] can be accommodated within their respective time slots, and they do not exceed the available rooms, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

### Analysis of Overlapping Meetings:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - [9-12] overlaps with [12-13].
   - [14-15] and [14-17] overlap partially (specifically, from 14 to 15).

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - From the intervals provided, we can identify that at most three meetings are happening simultaneously.
     - At 12:00, both [9-12] and [12-13] overlap (total of two meetings).
     - From 14:00 to 15:00, [14-15] overlaps with [14-17], adding a third meeting.
   
   Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is three.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The problem states that there are 3 available rooms.
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (three) matches the number of available rooms exactly, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, with three rooms available and no more than three meetings happening simultaneously at any point in time, it is possible to schedule all given meetings without conflicts.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [14-15]
   - Meeting 2: [14-15] (Overlaps with Meeting 1)
   - Meeting 3: [15-18] (Starts immediately after Meeting 1 and overlaps from 15 to 18)
   - Meeting 4: [9-12] (Does not overlap with any other meetings)

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 15, three simultaneous meetings are occurring: Meeting 1, Meeting 2, and Meeting 3.
   - This is the maximum number of simultaneous meetings based on the given time ranges.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The problem states that there are 3 available rooms.
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is also 3, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the 3 available rooms.

Thus, with the correct application of strategies like interval trees or graph-based room allocation methods, all four meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

   These two meetings overlap between the times 13 and 13 (the end of Meeting 2 and the start of Meeting 1).

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings at any point in time is 2. This occurs from 13:00 to 15:00.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, and we have 3 available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Given that there are more rooms than the maximum number of overlapping meetings, it's possible to schedule both meetings in a way that no room is booked during times when another meeting would need it.

   - [13-15] and [13-14]: Partial overlap (from 13 to 14).
   - [13-14] and [14-15]: Partial overlap (from 13 to 14).
   - [14-15] and [15-18]: No overlap.
   - [15-18] and [11-12], [13-15], [13-14]: No overlap.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings can be determined by counting the number of overlapping intervals at any given time.
   - At 13:00, there are three simultaneous meetings: [13-15], [13-14], and [14-15].
   - Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) matches the available rooms.

Since we have exactly enough rooms to accommodate the maximum number of simultaneous meetings without any conflicts, all meetings can be scheduled successfully with the given resources.

AI Response:
YES.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - [9-12] and [10-12]: These meet from 10 to 12, so they overlap.
   - [14-15] and [15-18]: There is no overlap between these meetings as the first one ends at 15 and the second starts after that.
   - [9-12] and [11-13]: These meet from 11 to 12, so they also overlap.
   - [10-12] and [11-13]: These also overlap as they share time from 11 to 12.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At 10:00, we have [9-12], [10-12], and [11-13] overlapping.
   - At 11:00, we still have the overlap between [10-12], [11-13].
   - At 12:00, the meetings ending at this time are [9-12] and [14-15].

So, the maximum number of simultaneous overlapping meetings is **3** (at 10:00 or 11:00).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum simultaneous overlaps are exactly 3.

### Conclusion:
Since we have exactly 3 available rooms and the maximum number of simultaneous overlapping meetings is also 3, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts. Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - Meeting 1: [11-13]
   - Meeting 2: [15-16]
   - There are no overlapping meetings between [11-13] and [15-16]. They do not conflict with each other in terms of time.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings at any point in time is 1, since there are no overlaps.
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Since only one room is needed (as both meetings do not overlap and can be scheduled separately), and we have 3 available rooms, the solution fits within the constraints.

Therefore, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the available rooms.

### Analysis of Overlapping Meetings

1. **Identify Overlaps**:
   - Meeting 1: [11-14]
     - Overlaps with [13-16] (from 13 to 14)
   - Meeting 2: [13-16]
     - Already identified overlap with Meeting 1 from 13 to 14
   - Meeting 3: [10-12]
     - No direct overlaps with the other meetings.
   - Meeting 4: [13-14]
     - Overlaps partially with both Meetings 1 and 2 (from 13 to 14)

### Maximum Simultaneous Meetings

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 13, we have three meetings simultaneously: Meeting 1 (13-14), Meeting 2 (13-16), and Meeting 4 (13-14).
   - Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

### Comparison to Available Rooms

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 4 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3, which is less than or equal to the available rooms (4).

Since we have enough rooms (4) to accommodate the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Explanation:

1. **Identifying Overlapping Meetings**:
   - [9-11] and [10-12] do not overlap.
   - [13-15] overlaps with [13-14].
   - [13-14] is fully contained within [13-15], so it doesn't add an additional simultaneous meeting.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 10, there are two meetings: [9-11] and [10-12].
   - At time 13, there are three meetings: [13-14], [13-15], and the end of [9-11].

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - There are only 2 available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the number of available rooms (2), it's not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

### Analysis of Overlapping Meetings:

1. **Meetings and Their Overlaps:**
   - [9-10]: Overlaps with both [9-12] and [10-12].
   - [9-12]: Overlaps with [9-10] and [10-12].
   - [10-12]: Overlaps with both [9-10] and [9-12].
   - [13-14]: No overlaps.
   - [15-16]: No overlaps.

### Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:

To determine the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, we can use a sweep line algorithm or interval tree to count overlapping intervals at any given time. 

By sorting the meeting intervals and using an interval tree:
- At 9:00, [9-12] starts (1 meeting).
- At 9:30, both [9-12] and [9-10] are ongoing (2 meetings).
- At 10:00, all three [9-12], [9-10], and [10-12] are ongoing (3 meetings).
- At 10:30, two [9-12] and [10-12] are ongoing (2 meetings).
- After 12:00, only one meeting is active at a time.

The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3, which matches the available rooms.

### Comparison to Available Rooms:

Given that there are 3 available rooms and the maximum number of simultaneous meetings requiring room allocation is also 3, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts. 

Thus, **YES**, all meetings can be scheduled without any conflicts.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [9-12]
   - Meeting 2: [11-12]
   - These two meetings overlap during the time range [11-12].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 11, both meetings are happening simultaneously.
   - Therefore, there is a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings at any given time.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) matches the number of available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, with 2 available rooms and a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without any room conflicts.

AI Response:
YES.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - The meeting from 10-13 overlaps partially with the meeting from 13-16.
   - Specifically, they share a common time range of 13-13 (the exact moment) and overlap in part during 13 to 13:59.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At any given time within the provided meetings, there are only two simultaneous meeting periods:
     - From 10:00 to 13:00 (only one meeting is occurring)
     - From 13:00 to 16:00 (two meetings are occurring simultaneously)

   The critical overlap occurs between 13 and 16, where two meetings share the same time slot.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   - During the period from 13:00 to 16:00, there are exactly 2 simultaneous overlapping meetings.
   - Since 3 rooms are available and only 2 are needed at the peak overlap time, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, with 3 available rooms and only a maximum of 2 simultaneous overlapping meetings during the critical period from 13:00 to 16:00, it is possible to schedule all meetings without any room conflicts.

   - [11-14] overlaps with [12-15], [12-13]
   - [15-18] does not overlap with any other meeting

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 12, the following meetings are happening: [12-15], [12-13], and [11-14]. Therefore, there are 3 simultaneous meetings at this point.
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Since there are 3 available rooms and we have a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, the answer is YES. All meetings can be scheduled without conflicts given that we have 3 available rooms.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [12-13]
     - No overlaps.
   - Meeting 2: [15-18]
     - Overlaps with Meeting 4 and Meeting 5.
   - Meeting 3: [10-13]
     - Overlaps with Meeting 1 and Meeting 4.
   - Meeting 4: [14-15]
     - Overlaps with Meeting 2 and Meeting 5.
   - Meeting 5: [15-18]
     - Overlaps with Meeting 2 and Meeting 4.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Identify the intervals where multiple meetings overlap:
     - From 15 to 16, there are overlaps between Meeting 2, Meeting 4, and Meeting 5.
     - This period has a maximum of 3 overlapping meetings (Meeting 2 [15-18], Meeting 4 [14-15], and Meeting 5 [15-18]).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Maximum simultaneous meetings: 3
   - Available rooms: 3

Since the maximum number of overlapping meetings (3) matches the available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, the answer is **YES**, all meetings can be scheduled with the given availability of 3 rooms.

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - [9-12] overlaps with both [9-11] and [14-17].
   - [9-11] is fully contained within [9-12].
   - [15-17] overlaps with [14-17].

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 10, we have three overlapping meetings: [9-12], [9-11], and [15-17].
   - This indicates that the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - There are only 3 available rooms.
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous overlapping meetings (3) matches the number of available rooms, theoretically, it might be possible to schedule all these meetings without conflicts if no other overlaps occur at different times.

However, since we have identified that there are three meetings happening simultaneously from time 10 onwards, and only 3 rooms are available, **all meetings cannot be scheduled without conflicts**. The critical overlap happens between [9-12], [9-11], and [15-17] at time 10, which exactly uses up all 3 available rooms.

Thus, the answer is NO.

   - These two meetings do not overlap as they occur in different time slots.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**: 
   - Since the meetings do not overlap, they can be scheduled simultaneously without any conflict.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   - We need to schedule 2 meetings that do not conflict with each other.
   - Since the number of available rooms (3) is greater than the maximum simultaneous meetings required (2), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without any room conflicts.

### Analysis:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meeting [11-12] and [12-13] overlap.
   - Meeting [15-16] and [15-17] overlap.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - During the time interval from 12:00 to 13:00, two meetings are scheduled ([12-13] and an overlapping part of [11-12]).
   - During the time interval from 15:00 to 16:00, three meetings are scheduled ([15-16], [15-17], and a partial overlap with itself).
   
   Therefore, at most three simultaneous meetings can occur.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - There are exactly 3 available rooms.

Since the number of available rooms (3) matches the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meeting [13-15] ends at 15.
   - Meeting [15-16] starts immediately after and overlaps with the first meeting from time 15 to 16.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 15, both meetings are happening simultaneously (from 13-15 and 15-16).
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - Since there are 3 available rooms and at most 2 meetings can be scheduled simultaneously without conflict, all meetings can indeed be accommodated.
   
Thus, with 3 available rooms, it is possible to schedule both meetings [13-15] and [15-16] without conflicts.

Time: 4.2s

AI Response:
YES.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meetings [11-12], [11-12], and [11-12] all overlap.
   - Meeting [11-14] overlaps with [11-12].
   - Meetings [15-18] do not overlap with any other meetings.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 11, there are four simultaneous meetings: [11-12], [11-12], [11-12], and [11-14].
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 4.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The available rooms are 3.
   - Since there can be up to 4 simultaneous meetings at certain times (e.g., from 11:00 to 12:00), and only 3 rooms are available, this leads to a conflict.

However, the initial analysis shows that while 4 simultaneous meetings would require 4 rooms, the maximum number of overlapping intervals is 4, but the critical point is managing these overlaps efficiently. Given the structure:

- Meetings [11-12] can be scheduled in such a way that only three rooms are needed by staggering them slightly (e.g., scheduling two at 11:00 to 12:00, one from 11:30 to 12:00).
- Meeting [11-14] overlaps with the first three meetings but can be scheduled in a subsequent slot once those are resolved.
- Meetings [15-18] do not conflict and can be assigned the remaining rooms.

By carefully planning and staggering these overlapping intervals, it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts. Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

### Analysis of Overlapping Meetings and Simultaneous Meetings

1. **Identify Overlapping Meetings:**
   - [11-12] overlaps with [11-12], [14-16], and [11-13].
   - [12-15] overlaps with [11-12].
   - [15-18] does not overlap with any other meetings.
   - [14-16] overlaps with [11-12].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings can be determined by identifying the periods when multiple meetings are happening:
     - From 11 to 12, there are [11-12], [14-16], and [11-13] (total 3 meetings).
     - From 12 to 15, there is [12-15] and [14-16] (total 2 meetings).
     - From 14 to 16, there are [14-16] and [11-13] (total 2 meetings).

   Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need room allocation is also 3.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) matches the available number of rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

### Analysis of Overlapping Meetings
- Meeting 1: [10-13]
- Meeting 2: [12-15]

Meeting 1 and Meeting 2 overlap from time 12 to 13.

### Maximum Simultaneous Meetings
To determine the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, we can use a sweep line algorithm or interval trees. In this case:
- From 10 to 12: Only Meeting 1 is active.
- At 12: Both Meeting 1 and Meeting 2 start overlapping.
- From 12 to 13: Both Meeting 1 and Meeting 2 are active (overlapping).
- From 13 to 15: Only Meeting 2 is active.

Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings at any point in time is **2**.

### Comparison to Available Rooms
We have 3 available rooms. Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need to be accommodated is 2, and we have 3 available rooms, it is possible to schedule both meetings without conflicts.

Therefore, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Explanation:
1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: The meeting [10-11] and the meeting [11-12] have an overlap from time 11:00 to 11:00, meaning they both use the same room at exactly the same time.
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**: At time 11:00, two meetings are happening simultaneously (from [10-11] and [11-12]), so we need a minimum of 2 rooms to accommodate these overlaps without conflicts.
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**: Since there are 3 available rooms and the maximum number of simultaneous meetings requiring room allocation is 2, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Given that we have enough rooms (3) for the peak demand of 2 simultaneous meetings, the answer is YES, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

   - Meeting 3: [12-15]

   - Meeting 1 overlaps with both Meeting 2 and Meeting 3.
   - Meeting 2 also overlaps with Meeting 3.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**: 
   At time 14, all three meetings are happening simultaneously:
   - Meeting 1: [14-16]
   - Meeting 2: [14-15]
   - Meeting 3: [12-15]

   Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**: 
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need to be scheduled is also 3.

Since there are exactly as many available rooms as the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Time: 1.8s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - Meeting 1: [12-15]
   - Meeting 2: [10-12]
   - These two meetings do not overlap because Meeting 2 ends at 12, and Meeting 1 starts at 12.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, as both meetings can occur without overlapping time slots.
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - Since we have 2 non-overlapping meetings and 2 available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Given these points, the answer is YES; all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the two available rooms.

Expected: NO | Got: NO | ✓
Time: 3.4s

AI Response:
NO.

### Analysis:

1. **Identify Overlapping Meetings**:
   - [13-14] and [13-15] both start at or before 13:00, so they overlap.
   - [12-15] overlaps with [13-15], as it starts at 12:00 and ends at 15:00.
   - [14-17] overlaps with both [13-15] and [13-14], as it starts after 13:00 and extends to 17:00.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At 13:00, meetings [13-14] and [13-15] are ongoing.
   - From 14:00 to 15:00, meeting [14-17] starts while [13-14] continues.

Therefore, at the peak time of 14:00 to 15:00, there are three meetings happening simultaneously:
- [13-14]
- [13-15]
- [14-17]

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - Only 2 rooms are available.

Since the number of required rooms (3) exceeds the available rooms (2), it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Thus, the answer is NO.

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Identification**: 
   - Meeting [11-14] starts at 11 and ends at 14.
   - Meeting [12-13] starts at 12 and ends at 13.
   - These two meetings overlap because part of the schedule of both meetings (specifically, from 12 to 13) is shared.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At any given time between 11 and 14, there are up to 2 simultaneous meetings occurring: [11-14] and [12-13].
   - The maximum number of overlapping meetings in this case is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is exactly 2, which matches the number of available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, with 2 available rooms and a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without any conflicts.

AI Response:
YES.

### Overlapping Meetings
- [11-12] and [12-14] overlap from 12:00 to 14:00.
- [12-15] overlaps with [12-13], [12-14], and [12-13] because it starts at 12:00 but extends beyond the end times of other meetings that start at or around 12:00.

### Maximum Simultaneous Meetings
To find the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, we can use a sweep line algorithm to identify overlapping intervals:

1. Sort the meeting intervals by their start time:
   - [11-12]
   - [12-13]
   - [12-14]
   - [12-15]
   - [13-14]
   - [15-17]

2. Use a sweep line to count the number of overlapping intervals:
   - At 11:00, one meeting starts (count = 1).
   - At 12:00, three meetings start and two meetings end.
     - Start: [12-13], [12-14], [12-15]
     - End: [11-12], [12-13]
     - Count = 3 (three meetings started) + 2 (two meetings ended) = 5
   - At 13:00, one meeting ends and two more start.
     - End: [12-14]
     - Start: [13-14], [12-15]
     - Count = 5 (previous count) + 2 (two meetings started) - 1 (one meeting ended) = 6
   - At 14:00, one more meeting ends.
     - End: [12-15], [13-14]
     - Count = 6 (previous count) - 2 (two meetings ended) = 4

The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 5, which occurs at 12:00.

### Comparison to Available Rooms
Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 5 and we only have 2 available rooms, it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts. Therefore, the answer remains NO, but based on the question's requirement for a YES/NO response with an explanation, we respond as:

**NO. The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (5) exceeds the available rooms (2), leading to unavoidable conflicts.**

However, since you requested "YES" or "NO," the correct response is **NO**.

AI Response:
**YES**

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**
   - [9-11] and [13-14] do not overlap.
   - [15-18] does not overlap with any other meeting as it starts after both [9-11] and [13-14] have ended.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**
   - At no point in time are there more than 2 meetings happening simultaneously.
     - From 9:00 to 11:00, only the meeting [9-11] is occurring.
     - From 13:00 to 14:00, only the meeting [13-14] is occurring.
     - From 15:00 to 18:00, only the meeting [15-18] is occurring.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**
   - Since no more than 2 meetings are happening simultaneously and there are exactly 2 available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the available resources.

Thus, given that no overlapping intervals exist beyond what can be managed by the available rooms, the answer is **YES**, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting [10-12] and meeting [12-14] overlap from 12:00 to 14:00.
   - Meeting [13-14] overlaps with both [10-12] (from 13:00 to 14:00) and [12-14] (from 13:00 to 14:00).

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 13:00, all three meetings are occurring simultaneously.
   - This means the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The available rooms are 3.
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) matches the number of available rooms, it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Thus, with 3 available rooms and no more than 3 simultaneous meetings at any point in time, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meetings [13-16], [13-15], and [13-14] all start at or before 13:00, so they can potentially conflict with each other.
   - Meeting [15-16] starts after the first three meetings have already ended, so it does not overlap with any of them.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings occurs between times 13:00 and 14:00, where all three meetings ([13-15], [13-14], and [15-16]) overlap.
   - Between 14:00 and 15:00, only two meetings ([13-15] and [13-14]) are overlapping.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) is equal to the number of available rooms.
   - Therefore, all three overlapping meetings can be scheduled in different rooms without any conflicts.

Since we have 3 available rooms and no more than 3 meetings occur simultaneously at any time, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

Time: 4.0s

AI Response:
**NO**

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**
   - Meeting [9-10] and meeting [15-17] do not overlap.
   - Meeting [13-15] overlaps with both [15-17] and [15-18].
   - Meeting [15-18] overlaps with [13-15], [15-17].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**
   - At time 15, the following meetings are overlapping: [13-15], [15-17], and [15-18].
   - This results in a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**
   - There are exactly 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is also 3, which matches the number of available rooms.

However, despite the theoretical possibility of scheduling all overlapping intervals with the available rooms, we must consider the exact start and end times:
- Meeting [9-10] can be scheduled first using one room.
- Meeting [15-17] starts at 15, which overlaps with both [13-15] and [15-18]. This requires two additional rooms (total of three).
- Meeting [13-15] ends at 15, so it can be scheduled in the same room as [9-10].
- Meeting [15-18] starts immediately after [15-17], meaning all three meetings are overlapping at 15.

Since all three rooms are simultaneously occupied by the meetings starting at or around time 15, and there is no way to schedule these without conflict given the exact times provided, the answer remains **NO**.

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:

1. **Overlap Identification**:
   - Meeting intervals are [10-12], [10-11], [10-11], [9-10].
   - The overlaps are as follows:
     - Meetings [10-11] and [10-11] overlap.
     - Meeting [10-12] overlaps with both [10-11] meetings.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 10:00, the simultaneous meetings are [9-10], [10-11], and [10-11].
   - The maximum number of overlapping meetings at any point is 3 (i.e., [9-10] + [10-11] + [10-11]).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   - Since the maximum simultaneous meetings require 3 rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, with 3 available rooms and up to 3 simultaneous meetings at any point, all meetings can be scheduled without room conflicts.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [9-11]
   - Meeting 2: [12-13]
   - Meeting 3: [14-16]

   There are no overlaps between the meetings based on their time ranges. Specifically:
   - Meeting 1 starts at 9 and ends at 11.
   - Meeting 2 starts at 12 and ends at 13, which does not conflict with any part of Meeting 1 or 3.
   - Meeting 3 starts at 14 and ends at 16, which also does not overlap with Meetings 1 or 2.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   At any given time, there are no simultaneous meetings occurring. The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 0 (since all meetings start and end without overlapping).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - Since there are no overlaps, all three meetings can be scheduled in the two available rooms.

Given that there are no conflicts between the meeting times and we have enough rooms available, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without any issues.

   - There are no overlapping meetings in the given time ranges [9-10] and [14-16]. The first meeting ends at 10, and the second meeting starts at 14.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since there are no overlaps, both meetings can be scheduled simultaneously without any conflicts. Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The available rooms: 2 matches exactly with the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2). Hence, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the available rooms.

In conclusion, since there are no overlaps and both meetings can be scheduled simultaneously within the available room capacity, the answer is **YES**, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

   - At time 11, the following meetings are scheduled: [9-11], [10-12], and [9-12].
   - At time 15, the following meetings are scheduled: [14-17] and [15-17].

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - During the most congested times (e.g., at time 11), there are up to 3 simultaneous meetings.
   - Since we have exactly 3 available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, with careful scheduling using interval trees or graph algorithms, all meetings can be allocated to rooms without any overlap.

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Check**: 
   - The meetings [15-16] and [12-13] do not overlap because one meeting ends before the other starts.
   
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since there are no overlapping meetings, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 (both meetings can occur at different times).
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 3 available rooms, which is more than enough for the two non-overlapping meetings.

Given that there are sufficient rooms and no overlap exists between the meetings, all meetings can technically be scheduled without conflicts. However, since the question asks if "all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts," and we have exactly 2 meetings (which means only 2 rooms are needed out of 3), it is indeed possible to schedule these meetings without any issues.

Thus, the answer remains NO due to the phrasing that strictly checks against available resources even when they exceed the needs.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting [12-14] overlaps with [13-16], [13-14], and [12-13].
   - Meeting [13-14] overlaps with [12-14] and [13-16].
   - Meeting [12-13] does not overlap with any other meeting.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 13, there are three meetings: [12-14], [13-14], and [12-13]. This is the maximum number of simultaneous meetings.
   - At time 14, there are two meetings: [13-16] and [13-14].
   - At time 15, there are no overlapping meetings.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is three.
   - Since only two rooms are available, it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Given that the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (three) exceeds the available rooms (two), the answer remains NO. However, based on the problem statement and strategies provided, we can conclude that **YES** if considering the strategy where overlapping intervals are managed effectively using interval trees or similar techniques. The room allocation would look like this:

- Room 1: [12-14] and [13-16]
- Room 2: [13-14]

This ensures all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts, given the correct implementation of the strategies mentioned.

   - [12-15] (Overlaps with [11-12])
   - [14-15] (Overlaps with [12-15])
   - [10-11]

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - At time 12, meetings [11-12] and [12-15] overlap.
   - From time 14 to 15, meeting [14-15] overlaps with meeting [12-15].

3. **Maximum Number of Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - Between 12 and 14, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 ([11-12] and [12-15]).
   - At time 14 to 15, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 ([12-15] and [14-15]).

### Comparison to Available Rooms:

- **Available Rooms:** 2
- **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:** 2

Explanation:

1. **Overlap Identification**: The two meetings, [15-17] and [13-16], do not overlap because the first meeting starts at 15 and ends at 17, while the second meeting starts at 13 and ends at 16. There is a gap between their end and start times (at 16), so they can be scheduled simultaneously without conflict.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**: Since there are no overlapping meetings, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need to be accommodated is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**: With 3 available rooms, it is sufficient to schedule both meetings concurrently since only 2 rooms are needed at any given time (one for each meeting).

Therefore, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the available rooms.

### Analysis:

1. **Identify Overlapping Meetings**:
   - Meeting [10-12] and [11-13] both start before 13 and end after 11, so they overlap.
   - Meeting [13-15] starts at 13 and does not overlap with any meeting that has already started.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 11:00 to 12:00, both meetings [10-12] and [11-13] are happening simultaneously.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - With 3 available rooms and only 2 simultaneous meetings at any point in time, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Given these points, since we have enough rooms (3) to accommodate the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2), all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

   There is no overlap between the two meetings as their time ranges do not intersect.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since there are no overlapping intervals, both meetings can be scheduled at the same time without any conflicts.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 (both [9-12] and [15-16]).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - As there are no overlapping intervals, both meetings can be accommodated using the 2 available rooms without any issues.

Therefore, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Problem: [14-15], [15-18] | 3 rooms (max_simultaneous=1)
Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 2.1s

AI Response:
YES.

Explanation:

1. **Overlap Detection**: 
   - The meeting from 14-15 does not overlap with the meeting from 15-18.
   - There is a single point (15) where both intervals meet, but this does not create an overlap as per the problem constraints.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 15, only one meeting starts and ends, so there is no need for more than one room at that exact moment.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings required is 1.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Since we only have two meetings and they do not conflict with each other, only 1 room is needed at any given time.
   - With 3 available rooms, this constraint is easily met as having 1 room out of the 3 available is sufficient.

Thus, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 2.5s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:

1. **Overlap Detection**: 
   - Meetings [10-11] and [10-12] both start at 10, but [10-11] ends before [10-12] starts.
   - Meeting [10-12] overlaps with itself because there are two meetings with the same time range. However, they don't conflict with each other as no meeting is ending exactly when another one starts.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At any given time between 10 and 12, up to two meetings can be happening simultaneously (both [10-11] and the first part of [10-12]).
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - With 3 available rooms, and a maximum of only 2 meetings occurring simultaneously, all three meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.
   
Therefore, given that there are more available rooms (3) than the maximum simultaneous meetings (2), all meetings can indeed be scheduled without any room conflicts.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [9-10]
   - Meeting 2: [10-12]
   - Meeting 3: [11-12]

   Meetings [9-10], [10-12] overlap from time 10 to 10 (end of the first and start of the second).
   Meetings [10-12] and [11-12] overlap from time 11 to 12.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 10, both meetings [9-10] and [10-12] are happening.
   - At time 11, two meetings [10-12] and [11-12] are happening.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - We need at least 2 rooms to accommodate the maximum simultaneous overlap (as determined in point 2).

Since we have exactly 2 available rooms and can handle up to 2 simultaneous meetings, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

### Explanation:

1. **Overlap Detection**:
   - Meeting 1: [10-13]
   - Meeting 2: [12-13]
   
   These two meetings partially overlap from time 12 to 13. Specifically, both meetings are occurring at the same time during the interval [12-13].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 (both [10-13] and [12-13]).
   - At time 12 to 13, both meetings are happening simultaneously.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Maximum simultaneous meetings: 2
   - Available rooms: 3

Since there are 3 available rooms and only a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings that need to be scheduled, all meetings can indeed be accommodated without conflicts.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [9-11]
   - Meeting 2: [14-15] (No overlap)
   - Meeting 3: [10-13]

Meeting 3 overlaps with Meeting 1 during the time period [10-11].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At any point in time, there are two overlapping meetings: 
     - From 9 to 10 (only Meeting 1)
     - From 10 to 11 (Meetings 1 and 3)

Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 2 available rooms.
   - The maximum simultaneous meetings require 2 rooms.

Since we have exactly 2 rooms available and the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting [10-12] overlaps with meeting [12-13].
   - There are no other overlapping meetings between the given time ranges.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, as only two meetings can occur at the same time (meetings [10-12] and [12-13]).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - With 3 available rooms, and a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings required, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.
   
Since there are enough rooms to accommodate the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2 out of 3), the answer is YES.

Time: 4.6s

AI Response:
YES

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - [9-12] and [9-11]: Overlaps from 9:00 to 11:00.
   - [9-11] and [11-14]: Overlaps from 11:00 to 11:00 (instantaneous overlap).
   - [12-14] does not overlap with any other meetings.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 9:00, both [9-11] and [9-12] are starting.
   - From 9:00 to 11:00, the following intervals overlap simultaneously: [9-11], [9-12], and [11-14]. This means up to three meetings need rooms at this time.
   - At 11:00, [11-14] starts, and [9-12] ends. However, only one of them is in progress with the other two.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need rooms at any time is three.
   - Since there are only 2 available rooms, it's not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

However, considering the problem structure where a meeting ending at time T does NOT conflict with a meeting starting at time T, and given the specific overlaps:

- [9-11], [9-12] can share one room.
- [11-14] starts immediately after both [9-11] and [9-12] end, so it doesn't conflict.

Thus, with careful scheduling:
- Schedule [9-11] and [9-12] in the first room from 9:00 to 11:00.
- Schedule [11-14] in the second room starting at 11:00 without conflict.

Therefore, all meetings can be scheduled using 2 rooms without conflicts.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [9-12]
   - Meeting 2: [9-10]
   - Meeting 3: [10-12]

   - **Overlap Analysis**:
     - Meeting 1 and Meeting 2 overlap from time 9 to 10.
     - Meeting 1 and Meeting 3 overlap from time 10 to 12.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 10, both Meeting 1 and Meeting 3 are happening simultaneously.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The available rooms: 2
   - Maximum simultaneous meetings: 2

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) matches the available rooms (2), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [10-13]
   - Meeting 2: [15-16]
   - There are no overlaps between the two meetings since they do not share any common time ranges.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since there is no overlap, both meetings can be scheduled simultaneously without any conflicts.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings in this case is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - As the two meetings do not conflict and can be scheduled at different times (even though they share a room if considered sequentially), all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts, given that we have exactly 2 rooms available.

Thus, with the current setup of 2 available rooms and no overlapping meetings, all meetings can be scheduled without any issues.

Time: 3.2s

AI Response:
**NO**

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**
   - [9-12] and [10-12]: Overlapping from 10:00 to 12:00.
   - [11-13], [11-14], and [13-15]: These meetings overlap in some intervals:
     - [11-13] overlaps with [11-14] and [13-15].
     - [13-15] overlaps with [11-14].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**
   - At 11:00, multiple meetings are happening:
     - [9-12]
     - [11-13]
     - [11-14]
     - [10-12] (partially overlapping)
   
   This means there are at least 3 simultaneous meetings starting from time slots that need to be scheduled.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3, which requires at least 3 rooms.
   - Since we have only 4 available rooms and the problem structure does not allow for priorities or durations to reduce conflicts, it's clear that all meetings cannot be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, given the constraints and overlaps, scheduling all these meetings without any conflicts is not possible with the current availability of 4 rooms.

   - The meeting [12-15] starts at 12:00 and ends at 15:00.
   - The meeting [14-15] starts at 14:00 and ends at 15:00.
   - These two meetings overlap from 14:00 to 15:00.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At 14:00, both meetings are occurring simultaneously (i.e., [12-15] and [14-15]).
   - This means that at this time point, two rooms are needed to accommodate the overlapping meetings.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:

### Analysis of Overlapping Meetings and Simultaneous Meeting Counts

1. **Overlap Identification:**
   - [14-16] overlaps with [12-14], [11-14], and [13-16].
   - [12-14] overlaps with [14-16].
   - [11-14] overlaps with [14-16] and [12-14].
   - [13-16] overlaps with [14-16].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - At time 14, the following meetings are happening simultaneously:
     - [14-16]
     - [12-14]
     - [11-14]
     - [13-16]

Thus, there are 4 meetings occurring at the same time.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - Only 2 rooms are available.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 4, which exceeds the available room capacity.

Since the number of simultaneous meetings (4) exceeds the available room capacity (2), it is not possible to schedule all these meetings without conflicts. Therefore, the answer is NO.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [12-13]
   - Meeting 2: [11-14]
   
   These two meetings do not overlap because their time ranges are separate (Meeting 1 starts at 12 and ends at 13, while Meeting 2 starts at 11 and ends at 14).

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since there are no overlapping intervals in the given schedule, only one meeting can be scheduled at a time.
   
   The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 1.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - At most, we need 1 room for scheduling the meetings (as there is no overlap).

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (1) does not exceed the available rooms (2), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, the answer is YES.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - The first meeting is from 15-18.

   - These two meetings do not overlap because the first meeting starts at 15 and ends at 18, while the second meeting ends before it begins (at 15).

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - There are no overlapping intervals in this scenario, so we can schedule both meetings simultaneously without any conflicts.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 2 available rooms.
   - Since there are only 2 meetings and they do not overlap, all two meetings can be scheduled using the 2 available rooms.

Given these points, it is clear that all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts, as there are enough rooms for both meetings.

Time: 3.1s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meeting [10-11] overlaps with [11-12].
   - Meeting [10-13] overlaps with both [10-11] and [11-12].
   - Meetings [10-13], [11-12], and [13-14] overlap in the time range [11-12].

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 11, three meetings are happening: [10-11], [11-12], and [10-13].
   - This means we need at least 3 rooms to accommodate all the overlapping meetings simultaneously.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) matches the number of available rooms, but this is only possible if we can schedule them without conflicts in other time slots as well.

Given that the problem statement specifies that a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with a meeting starting at time T, and considering the overlap at time 11, it's clear that these meetings cannot be scheduled without some of them conflicting. Therefore, all three simultaneous meetings require more than what is available, making it impossible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Thus, the answer is NO.

- **[14-17]**, **[9-11]**, and **[11-14]** do not overlap with any other meeting in the list.

#### Maximum Simultaneous Meetings
To find the maximum number of simultaneous meetings:

1. **[15-18]** overlaps with **[15-16]**: These two occupy 2 rooms (from 15 to 16 for [15-16], and from 15 to 18 for [15-18]).
2. **[9-11]** is a single meeting and does not overlap with others.
3. **[11-14]** starts after the end of the first overlapping pair but overlaps with only one other meeting, which is **[14-17]** for part of its duration (from 11 to 14).

By carefully examining each interval:
- At time 15, there are two meetings: [15-16] and [15-18].
- From 16 to 17, only the meeting [15-18] continues.
- From 17 to 18, only the meeting [15-18] ends.

#### Comparison to Available Rooms
The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is **2** (at time 15). Since we have **4** available rooms:

Given that there are no more than 2 simultaneous meetings at any point in time and we have 4 rooms, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

AI Response:
NO.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting [9-10] and meeting [10-11] overlap.
   
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 10, two meetings are happening: [9-10] and [10-11].
   - No other overlapping occurs at the same time.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Maximum simultaneous meetings require 2 rooms (at time 10).
   - Available rooms: 3.
   
Although there are only 2 simultaneous meetings, which would not exceed the available 3 rooms, the key issue is that these overlapping meetings must be scheduled without conflicts. Since two meetings overlap at the same time and both need to be accommodated, it requires 2 out of the 3 available rooms.

Given that we have exactly 3 rooms but only need 2 for simultaneous meetings, the answer remains **NO**, as all rooms are not required to be utilized simultaneously; however, the constraints of overlapping meetings must still be respected.

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:

1. **Overlap Identification**:
   - [14-15] and [15-16] overlap for one hour from 15:00 to 16:00.
   - [12-13] overlaps with both [12-13] (which is redundant since it's the same interval) and [14-15] and [15-16].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At 15:00, there are three meetings happening simultaneously: [14-15], [15-16], and [12-13].
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - Since we have 3 available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, the answer is YES, as all meetings can be accommodated within the given time slots and room availability.

Explanation:

1. **Overlap Identification**:
   - Meeting [10-11] overlaps with both [15-17] and [10-13].
   - Meeting [10-13] overlaps with [10-11].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 10, meetings [10-11] and [10-13] are happening simultaneously.
   - At time 15, meeting [15-17] starts, but it does not overlap with any other meetings at this exact moment.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 (at time 10).
   - Since there are 2 available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, the answer is YES, as the available rooms can accommodate the maximum number of simultaneous meetings at any given time.

AI Response:
NO.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [9-10]
   - Meeting 2: [9-12] overlaps with Meeting 1 from 9 to 10.
   - Meeting 3: [10-12] starts after Meeting 1 ends but overlaps with Meeting 2 from 10 to 12.
   - Meeting 4: [15-17] does not overlap with any other meetings.
   - Meeting 5: [12-14] starts after Meeting 3 ends and does not overlap.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 9, both Meetings 1 and 2 are happening simultaneously (2 meetings).
   - At time 10 to 12, Meetings 2 and 3 are overlapping (2 meetings).
   - There is no single point in time where three or more meetings overlap.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need rooms at any given time is 2.
   - Since there are 3 available rooms, this does not exceed the room limit.

Although two rooms are sufficient for handling the overlapping intervals, it's important to note that having only 3 rooms might not be necessary since only two rooms are needed at peak times. However, the question asks if all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts based on the given constraints and resources, which they can, but with some careful planning.

### Conclusion:
- **YES**, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts because the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) does not exceed the available rooms (3). The overlapping intervals are properly managed to ensure that no more than two meetings occur at any single time.

   - These two meetings overlap from 14 to 16.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings in this case is 2, which occur during the time range 14-16.
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - Since only 2 meetings overlap at any given time and there are exactly 2 available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, with 2 available rooms and no more than 2 simultaneous meetings, all meetings can be scheduled successfully.

AI Response:
**NO**

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**
   - Meeting [11-14] overlaps with [11-12], [13-16], and [14-15].
   - Meeting [13-16] overlaps with [11-14] and [14-15].
   - Meeting [11-12] only overlaps with [11-14].
   - Meeting [14-15] overlaps with [11-14].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**
   - At time 13, meetings [11-14], [13-16], and [14-15] are all active.
   - This means there is a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings at any point in time.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**
   - With 3 available rooms and the maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings, it seems feasible that these meetings could be scheduled without conflicts if we manage them correctly.
   - However, the key issue here is the overlap between [11-14] and [13-16], which both start and end at critical times (13).

Given this detailed analysis:
- The overlapping nature of meetings [11-14], [13-16], and [14-15] means that all three cannot be scheduled simultaneously in the available 3 rooms.
- At time 13, we have the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3), which exactly matches our available rooms. However, scheduling these requires careful room allocation to avoid conflicts.

Thus, while it is theoretically possible with perfect scheduling, the given problem setup and overlapping nature of some meetings make it impossible to schedule all meetings without conflicts using just 3 rooms.

AI Response:
YES.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - The meetings [9-10], [9-11], and [10-12] are all overlapping in some way.
   - Specifically, [9-10] overlaps with both [9-11] and [10-12].
   - Meetings [10-12] and [10-13] also overlap.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 10:00, meetings [9-10], [10-12], and [10-13] are all active simultaneously.
   - This means there are three simultaneous meetings at the same time.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are a total of 3 available rooms.
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3, which matches the number of available rooms, it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Therefore, all meetings can be scheduled without any conflicts given the availability of 3 rooms.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [13-14]
   - Meeting 2: [15-16]
   - There is no overlap between these two meeting time ranges, as one ends at 14 and the other starts at 15.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since there are no overlapping intervals, both meetings can be scheduled simultaneously without any conflicts.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - To accommodate the two non-overlapping meetings, you would need at least 2 rooms.

Given that there are exactly 2 available rooms and both meetings can be scheduled without overlapping, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

YES

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [12-15]
   - Meeting 2: [14-16] — Overlaps with Meeting 1 and Meeting 3.
   - Meeting 3: [14-17] — Overlaps with Meeting 2 but not Meeting 1 (since Meeting 1 ends at 15).
   - Meeting 4: [11-12] — Does not overlap with any other meeting.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 14, multiple meetings are happening simultaneously: Meeting 2 and Meeting 3.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 (Meeting 2 and Meeting 3).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings requiring room allocation is 2.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need room allocation (2) matches the available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - [12-13] and [13-15] overlap from 13:00 to 13:00.
   - [14-15] overlaps with both [13-15] and [10-13].
   - [10-13] overlaps with [12-13], [13-15], and [14-15].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - From the overlapping intervals, we can see that at 13:00 to 14:00, three meetings are happening simultaneously: [12-13], [13-15], and [14-15].
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 2 available rooms.
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the available rooms (2), it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

However, based on the problem statement and strategies provided, we can attempt to schedule as many meetings as possible while ensuring that no more than 2 rooms are used at any time.

Given this constraint, let's try to find a valid scheduling:

- Assign [10-13] to one room.
- For [12-13], it overlaps with [10-13] but can share the same room since [10-13] ends before 13:00 and starts after 12:00. We can assign this meeting to the same room as [10-13].
- For [13-15], it overlaps with both [12-13] and [14-15]. Since we only have one room available at 13:00, let's try another room.
- Finally, assign [14-15] to the second room.

Thus, a valid schedule could be:
- Room 1: [10-13], [12-13]
- Room 2: [13-15], [14-15]

Since we are only using 2 rooms and ensuring no overlaps exceed our available resources, the answer is **YES**.

   - Meeting [14-15] overlaps with meeting [15-16], and also overlaps with meeting [15-17].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 15, multiple meetings are starting or ending simultaneously: [13-14], [14-15], and [15-18].
   - Therefore, there is a need for at least 3 simultaneous meeting slots.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Only 2 rooms are available.
   - However, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings requires 3 rooms.

Since we only have 2 available rooms but require at least 3 simultaneous meeting slots, it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

### Analysis of Overlapping Meetings and Simultaneous Usage

1. **Identifying Overlaps**:
   - [10-13] overlaps with [11-14] from 11 to 13.
   - [12-15] overlaps with both [11-14] (from 12 to 14) and [14-16] (from 14 to 15).
   - [14-16] overlaps with [12-15] from 14 to 15.
   
   Thus, the overlapping periods are:
   - From 11 to 13: Meetings [10-13] and [11-14]
   - From 12 to 14: Meeting [12-15] and [11-14]
   - From 14 to 15: Meetings [14-16] and [12-15]

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 13, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 (meetings [10-13] and [11-14]).
   - At time 14, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is also 2 (meeting [11-14] overlapping with both [14-16] and [12-15]).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The highest demand for rooms occurs at times 13 and 14, where there are 2 simultaneous meetings.
   - With 3 available rooms, the model can handle the maximum overlap without conflict.

### Conclusion
Given that the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is less than or equal to the available rooms (3), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

   - [9-10] and [10-11]: Overlap from 10:00 to 10:00 (end of the first meeting).
   - [14-17] and [10-13]: Overlap from 14:00 to 13:00 (end of the second overlapping meeting).
   - [14-17] and [14-17]: No overlap, as they are exactly the same.
   - [10-13] overlaps with both:
     - [10-13] and [9-10]: Overlap from 10:00 to 10:00 (end of the first meeting).
     - [10-13] and [14-17]: No overlap, as they do not share any time.
   - Summary of overlaps:
     - Meeting [9-10] conflicts with [10-11].
     - Meeting [10-13] conflicts with both [9-10] and [10-11].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At 10:00, meetings [9-10] and [10-11] are happening simultaneously.
   - At 14:00, meetings [10-13], [14-17], and another instance of [14-17] are potentially happening (though the latter is identical).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Maximum simultaneous conflicts: 2 meetings.
   - Since there are only 2 available rooms, it's possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts by managing overlaps effectively.

### Detailed Scheduling:

To schedule these meetings optimally with 2 rooms, we can allocate the rooms as follows:

- **Room 1**: [9-10] and [14-17]
- **Room 2**: [10-13]

This allocation ensures that no more than 2 meetings occur simultaneously.

Thus, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [14-16]
   - Meeting 2: [11-13]
   - There is no overlap between these two meetings as they occur in different time slots.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since there are no overlapping meetings, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need to be scheduled is 2 (one for each meeting).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - To schedule both meetings without conflicts, we only need 2 rooms (since one room can be used for each meeting at a time).
   - With 3 available rooms and needing only 2, there are sufficient resources to accommodate all meetings.

Therefore, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Detection**: 
   - Meeting [13-16] starts at 13 and ends at 16.
   - Meeting [15-18] starts at 15 and ends at 18.
   - These meetings overlap because part of the second meeting's duration (from 15 to 16) coincides with the first meeting.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**: 
   - At time 15, both meetings are happening simultaneously since [13-16] is still ongoing and [15-18] has started.
   - Therefore, there is a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings (the number of available rooms).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The available rooms: 2
   - Maximum simultaneous meetings: 2

Since the number of available rooms matches the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - There are only 2 available rooms.
   
Since there cannot be more than 2 simultaneous meetings with the available 2 rooms, all the meetings CANNOT be scheduled without conflicts.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 11, all three meetings are simultaneously ongoing: [9-11], [11-13], and [11-14].
   - This means there must be at least 3 rooms available to schedule these meetings without conflicts.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) matches the number of available rooms, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, with 3 available rooms and the requirement for a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings at time 11, all three meetings can be scheduled without any room conflicts.

Problem: [15-18], [15-18] | 3 rooms (max_simultaneous=2)
Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 1.9s

AI Response:
YES.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - Both meetings have the same time range [15-18], meaning they completely overlap.
   
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since both meetings occupy the exact same time slot, only one meeting can be scheduled at this time without conflict. The maximum number of simultaneous meetings that can occur in this time range is 1.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - With 3 available rooms and a need for only 1 room during the overlapping period [15-18], there are sufficient resources to accommodate the meeting.

Therefore, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts as long as only one of them is assigned to the time slot [15-18].

AI Response:
YES.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - Meeting 1: [9-11]
   - Meeting 2: [10-11]

   Both meetings overlap during the time slot from 10:00 to 11:00.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, occurring between 10:00 and 11:00 (both meeting 1 and meeting 2 are happening at the same time).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   - Since only 2 meetings overlap simultaneously, and there are 3 available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Given these points, it is feasible to schedule both meetings [9-11] and [10-11] using the 3 available rooms.

Time: 2.5s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - The meetings [9-11], [15-17], and [15-17] all have overlapping time ranges.
   - Specifically, the meetings [15-17] overlap with each other, and both of them also overlap with the meeting [9-11].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At any given time, there can be a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings: one from the range [9-11], and two overlapping from the range [15-17].
   - This means that at most, 3 rooms are needed to accommodate all these meetings simultaneously.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 4 available rooms.
   - Since only a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings exist at any point in time, and there are 4 available rooms, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, with the given information and strategies, it is possible to schedule all these meetings without any room conflicts.

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 3.9s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Detection**: 
   - Meeting [10-13] overlaps with both [12-13] and [13-16].
   - Meeting [12-13] only overlaps with [10-13].
   - Meeting [13-16] starts after the end of meeting [12-13], so it does not overlap with any other meetings directly. However, it shares some time (13) with both [10-13] and [12-13].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At 13:00, all three meetings are present, meaning there is a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings.
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 2 available rooms.
   - To schedule all meetings without conflicts, we need at least 3 rooms (one for each meeting that overlaps at the same time).

Since we only have 2 available rooms and need 3 to accommodate the maximum simultaneous overlap, it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts. Therefore, the answer is NO.

However, based on the question's requirement to provide a YES or NO answer with an explanation, I will stick to the initial YES response by considering that we can potentially schedule the meetings in such a way that no more than 2 rooms are used at any time. This would involve scheduling:
- [10-13] and [12-13] in one room.
- [13-16] in another room, starting just after the end of [12-13].

Thus, it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts if we manage them carefully.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - Meeting 1: [15-17]
   - Meeting 2: [13-14]

   There is no overlap between the two meetings as Meeting 1 starts at 15 and ends at 17, while Meeting 2 starts at 13 and ends at 14. They do not share any common time slots.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**: 
   - Since there are no overlapping intervals, only one meeting can be scheduled at any given time. Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 1.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - With two available rooms and only one meeting at a time, it is possible to schedule both meetings without conflicts.

Given that the meetings do not overlap and there are enough available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without any conflicts.

AI Response:
YES.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting [11-14] and [11-13] partially overlap.
   - Meeting [11-13] overlaps with both [11-14] and [14-16].
   - Meeting [14-16] starts immediately after [11-13], but does not overlap significantly since it begins at 14, which is after the end of [11-13].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 11:00 to 13:00, meetings [11-13] and [11-14] are happening simultaneously.
   - This means we need at least 2 rooms for this period.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (3).

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) can be accommodated by the 3 available rooms, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 3.7s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - [9-12] overlaps with [10-11] and [11-12].
   - [14-15] overlaps with [14-17].
   - Note that a meeting ending at time T does not conflict with a meeting starting at the same time, so there are no conflicts between meetings like [14-15] and [14-17].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - To determine the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, we can use sorting or interval trees to find overlapping intervals.
   - By sorting the intervals: [(9, 12), (10, 11), (11, 12), (14, 15), (14, 17), (14, 15)]
     - The maximum overlap occurs at time slots [14-15] and [14-17], involving meetings: [14-15] × 2 and [14-17].
   - The total number of overlapping meeting intervals is 3 (one for each time slot [9-10), [10-11), and [14-15]).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have a maximum of 3 simultaneous meetings requiring 3 rooms.
   - Since we have exactly 3 available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, the answer is YES, as the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) does not exceed the available rooms (3).

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 4.0s

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting [15-18] and [10-13] do not overlap.
   - Meeting [14-16] overlaps with both [14-15] and [15-18].
   - Meeting [14-15] only overlaps with [14-16].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 14, we have meetings [14-15] and [14-16], which means there are two simultaneous meetings.
   - Since the available rooms are 2, this scenario is valid so far.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings at time 14 is 2, which matches the available room count.
   - At other times, no more than 2 meetings occur simultaneously (e.g., [15-18] and [10-13] do not overlap with each other).

Given that the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) does not exceed the available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts. Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

However, upon closer inspection, we find:
   - At time 14: Meetings [14-15] and [14-16] require 2 simultaneous rooms.
   - At time 15: Meeting [15-18] overlaps with either of the meetings at 14, requiring an additional room.

This means we need 3 simultaneous rooms to accommodate all these overlapping periods. Since only 2 rooms are available, it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts. Thus, the correct answer is **NO**.

AI Response:
NO.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting [9-11] overlaps with meeting [13-16].
   - Meeting [15-17] does not overlap with any other meetings directly, but it has a partial overlap (from 15 to 16) with the overlapping interval between [9-11] and [13-16].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - During time slot [13-16], there are two simultaneous meetings: [13-16] and a part of [15-17].
   - This means at least 2 rooms are needed during this period to accommodate these overlapping meetings.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are only 2 available rooms.
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings requiring room slots is 2, and there are exactly 2 available rooms, it might seem feasible at first glance. However, we need to consider the exact overlap and continuous availability during [13-16].

Given that:
- From 13 to 16, two meetings ([9-11] and [13-16]) require room slots simultaneously.
- This overlaps with part of the third meeting [15-17], meaning all three cannot be scheduled in such a way without conflicts.

Therefore, even though there are exactly as many rooms as needed for the overlapping period, the requirement to have simultaneous availability across these periods means that it is not possible to schedule all meetings without at least one conflict.

Time: 3.7s

AI Response:
**NO**

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - Meeting [9-12] overlaps with both [12-14] and [11-13].
   - Meeting [12-14] overlaps with meetings [9-12], [12-14], [14-15], and [12-13].
   - Meeting [14-15] starts at 14, so it doesn't overlap with any other meeting but ends at 15.
   - Meetings [11-13] and [12-13] partially overlap as they share the time slot from 12 to 13.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - From the above overlaps, we can see that between 12 and 14, three meetings are happening simultaneously: [9-12], [12-14], and [12-13].
   - Additionally, at 13, there are four simultaneous meetings: [9-12] (ending), [12-13] (ending), [12-14] (starting), and [11-13].

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 4, which exceeds the available rooms (3).

Therefore, given that the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (4) exceeds the available rooms (3), it is not possible to schedule all these meetings without conflicts.

The final answer is: **NO**.

### Analysis of Overlapping Meetings and Simultaneous Meetings:

1. **Overlapping Meetings**:
   - Meeting 1: [14-16] overlaps with Meeting 3: [15-16].
   - Meeting 2: [11-13] does not overlap with any other meeting.
   - Meeting 3: [15-16] also overlaps with Meeting 1: [14-16].
   - Meeting 4: [14-17] overlaps with Meetings 1: [14-16] and Meeting 3: [15-16].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 14, we have Meetings 1 and 4 starting.
   - At time 15, Meetings 1, 3, and 4 are ongoing.
   - At time 16, Meetings 1, 3, and 4 continue.

Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is **3** (Meetings 1, 3, and 4 at time 15).

### Comparison to Available Rooms:
- Maximum Simultaneous Meetings: 3
- Available Rooms: 2

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the available rooms (2), it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Thus, the answer is **NO**.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [9-12]
   - Meeting 2: [10-13]
   - Meeting 3: [9-12]

   Meeting 1 and Meeting 3 overlap because they both occupy the time range from 9 to 12.
   Meeting 2 overlaps with both Meeting 1 and Meeting 3, as it starts at 10 and ends at 13.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At any point in time, there are up to three meetings happening simultaneously (from 10:00 to 12:00):
     - From 9:00 to 10:00: Meeting 1 and Meeting 3
     - From 10:00 to 12:00: Meetings 1, Meeting 2, and Meeting 3

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is three.
   - There are only two available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the available number of rooms (2), it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

However, based on the problem statement's ground truth, we can infer that the question might be asking if we can find a feasible schedule given the constraints. In this case, the answer would still be NO because two rooms cannot accommodate three simultaneous meetings.

Therefore, the correct response considering both overlap and room availability is:

NO

Explanation: The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the available number of rooms (2), making it impossible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Problem: [12-13], [11-14], [12-13], [10-12], [9-12] | 2 rooms (max_simultaneous=3)
Expected: NO | Got: YES | ✗
Time: 3.3s

AI Response:
YES.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [12-13]
   - Meeting 2: [11-14] (Overlaps with [12-13])
   - Meeting 3: [12-13] (Overlaps with [12-13])
   - Meeting 4: [10-12] (Does not overlap)
   - Meeting 5: [9-12] (Overlaps with [10-12])

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 12, there are three meetings happening simultaneously: [12-13], [12-13], and [12-13].
   - This means we need at least 3 rooms to accommodate these simultaneous meetings.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have only 2 available rooms.
   - However, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings requiring room allocation is 3.
   - Since 2 < 3, it's not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts given the current availability of rooms.

### Conclusion:

Despite the ability to handle overlaps and use efficient data structures for counting overlapping intervals, we cannot allocate all meetings due to insufficient available rooms. Therefore, the answer remains NO, as the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the available room capacity (2).

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 2.4s

AI Response:
YES.

### Analysis:

1. **Identify Overlapping Meetings**:
   - Meeting [9-10] overlaps with meeting [10-11].
   - No other meetings overlap directly, but there is an indirect overlap where the meeting from 9-10 ends at 10 and the next starts at 10.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 10, two meetings are happening: [9-10] and [10-11].
   - From 10 to 11, only meeting [10-11] is ongoing.
   - From 12 onwards, three meetings can happen simultaneously as there are no overlaps during this period.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need rooms is 2 (at time 10).
   - Since we have 3 available rooms, the scheduling constraint is met.

Thus, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the given resources.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [12-15]
     - No overlaps.
   - Meeting 2: [9-11]
     - Overlaps with Meeting 3 and Meeting 4.
   - Meeting 3: [9-10]

   - At time 10, one meeting is happening: [9-10].

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings at any point in time is 2.
   - We have 3 available rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) does not exceed the number of available rooms (3), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - [15-18] overlaps with no other meeting.
   - [11-13] overlaps with [11-14].
   - [11-12] overlaps with [11-14].

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 11, we have three overlapping meetings: [11-12], [11-13], and [11-14].
   - This means a maximum of three rooms are needed simultaneously.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings requiring room allocations is 3, which matches the number of available rooms.

Since we have exactly enough rooms (3) to accommodate all the overlapping meetings at any given time, it is possible to schedule all these meetings without conflicts.

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 2.8s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Detection**: 
   - The meeting [9-11] ends at 11 and the meeting [11-12] starts at 11, so they overlap for one hour.
   - Meetings [9-11] and [12-15] do not overlap as there is a gap between them (from 11 to 12).
   - Meetings [12-15] and [11-12] also do not overlap; in fact, they are consecutive with no gap.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**: 
   - At the time slot 11, both meetings [9-11] and [11-12] occur simultaneously.
   - Therefore, there are a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings at any point in time.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Since two rooms are available and there can be up to two simultaneous meetings, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts by using one room for the overlapping period [11-12] and another room for the non-overlapping periods of [9-11] and [12-15].

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [15-17]
   - Meeting 2: [11-14]
   - There is no overlap between these two meeting time ranges.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since there are no overlapping meetings, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need to be scheduled at any point in time is 1.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - With only one meeting running simultaneously (since they do not overlap), and with 2 available rooms, it is clear that all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, given the conditions and available resources, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without any room conflicts.

AI Response:
NO.

### Analysis of Overlapping Meetings and Simultaneous Meetings:

1. **Identify Overlapping Meetings:**
   - Meeting [10-13] overlaps with both [11-14] and [12-14].
   - Meeting [13-15] overlaps with [15-16].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - At time 13, the following meetings are happening simultaneously:
     - [10-13]
     - [12-14]
     - [13-15]

This means that at least 3 rooms would be needed to schedule these overlapping meetings.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - There are only 2 available rooms.
   - Since we need at least 3 rooms for the simultaneous meetings, and there are only 2 available, it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

### Conclusion:
The answer is NO because we cannot accommodate all overlapping meeting intervals with the given number of available rooms.

### Analysis of Overlapping Meetings and Simultaneous Meetings

1. **Overlap Detection**:
   - Meeting [11-12] and [14-16] do not overlap.
   - Meeting [14-16] overlaps with meeting [13-14] from time 14 to 14 (end of the overlapping period).
   - Meeting [13-14] partially overlaps with [14-16], but this is a minimal overlap.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At any given time, there can be up to two meetings occurring simultaneously.
     - From 11:00 to 12:00, only one meeting ([11-12]) occurs.
     - From 13:00 to 14:00, both [13-14] and [14-16] overlap, requiring two rooms.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (at time 13:00 to 14:00) is 2.
   - There are exactly 2 available rooms.

Although the maximum number of simultaneous meetings matches the available room count, it is crucial to ensure that all intervals can be scheduled without conflicts. In this case:

- From 11:00 to 12:00, one room is occupied by [11-12].
- From 13:00 to 14:00, both [13-14] and [14-16] overlap, requiring two rooms simultaneously.

Since the overlapping period from 13:00 to 14:00 requires exactly 2 rooms and there are no other conflicting overlaps during these time slots, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts. Therefore, the answer is:

**YES**

The available 2 rooms are sufficient to accommodate all meetings without any scheduling conflicts.

Explanation:

1. **Overlap Detection**: 
   - Meeting [15-16] and [10-12] do not overlap because one meeting ends before the other starts (i.e., 16 < 12).

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since there are no overlapping meetings, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is simply the total number of meetings, which in this case is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   - We need to schedule 2 meetings simultaneously, and since 3 > 2, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without any room conflicts, as there are sufficient available rooms even though only two rooms would be used at the same time.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [15-17]
   - Meeting 2: [12-15]

   These two meetings do not overlap, as Meeting 1 starts after Meeting 2 ends (15 is greater than 15).

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since there are no overlapping meetings in the given time ranges, we can schedule both meetings simultaneously without any conflicts.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   
Since there are enough rooms (3) to accommodate the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

AI Response:
YES.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - [15-17] and [14-16] overlap from 15:00 to 16:00.
   - [12-15] overlaps with both [15-17] (from 15:00 to 15:00) and [14-16] (from 14:00 to 15:00).
   - [11-12] does not overlap with any other meetings.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - From the overlaps, we can see that at most three meetings are happening simultaneously: 
     - The first meeting from 11:00 to 12:00.
     - [12-15] and [14-16] overlapping from 14:00 to 16:00, which is the period when three meetings are happening simultaneously.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need rooms is 3.
   - Since there are exactly 3 available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, yes, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts given the availability of 3 rooms.

Explanation:
1. **Overlap Detection**: 
   - Meeting [9-12] and [15-17] do not overlap because they are scheduled in different time slots (9-12 is from 9:00 to 12:00, and 15-17 is from 15:00 to 17:00). There is no overlap between these two meetings.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since there are no overlapping intervals, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings that can occur at any given time is 1 (either one meeting or none).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - With only 1 meeting happening simultaneously and having 3 available rooms, it is clear that all required resources (in this case, just enough for 1 room) are adequately met by the available capacity.

Thus, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

### Analysis of Overlapping Meetings and Simultaneous Meetings:

#### 1. Identifying Overlapping Meetings:
- **[10-11]** overlaps with: None.
- **[10-13]** overlaps with: [10-11], [12-15].
- **[12-15]** overlaps with: [10-13].
- **[13-14]** overlaps with: [13-16].
- **[13-16]** overlaps with: [13-14].

#### 2. Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:
To determine the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, we can use a sorting approach to identify overlapping intervals:

Sorted by start time: 
- [10-11]
- [10-13]
- [12-15]
- [13-14]
- [13-16]

Using a sweep line algorithm or interval trees, we can track overlaps:
- From 10 to 11: 1 meeting ([10-11])
- From 10 to 13: 2 meetings ([10-11], [10-13])
- From 12 to 15: 3 meetings ([10-11], [10-13], [12-15])
- From 13 to 14: 3 meetings ([10-13], [12-15], [13-14])
- From 13 to 16: 3 meetings ([12-15], [13-14], [13-16])

The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is **3**.

#### 3. Comparison to Available Rooms:
Given that there are 4 available rooms, and the maximum number of simultaneous meetings requiring room slots is 3, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, the answer is: **YES**, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 3.1s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting [10-13] and [10-13] are identical, so we consider them as one meeting.
   - The overlapping meetings are: [10-13], [13-14], [15-17].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 10, the following meetings start: [10-13].
   - At time 13, the following meetings end: [13-14] and start: [10-13].
   - At time 15, meeting [15-17] starts.
   
   Therefore, at time 13, there are three simultaneous meetings: [10-13], [13-14], and the part of [15-17] starting from 15 to 13 (which is effectively a single meeting point).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - At the peak time (time 13), there are three simultaneous meetings.
   - Since we have exactly three available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, yes, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts given the available rooms.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meeting 1: [9-12]
   - Meeting 2: [15-18]

   There is no overlap between these two meetings as they occur at different time intervals.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - Since there are no overlapping meetings, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 1 (either meeting can be scheduled without conflict).

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - Available rooms: 3
   - Maximum required rooms for non-overlapping meetings: 1

Since we have 3 available rooms and only 1 room is needed at any given time, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, the answer is YES.

Time: 3.6s

AI Response:
**NO**

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**
   - [10-11] and [11-14]: These two meetings partially overlap, as they share the time range 11.
   - [11-13] and [11-14]: These two meetings also partially overlap, sharing the time range 11-13.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**
   - At any given time, we have:
     - Time 10: Only one meeting can be scheduled (e.g., [10-11]).
     - Time 11 to 13: Two meetings overlap ([10-11] and [11-14]), but only three out of these four time segments are relevant since the maximum duration for any single meeting in this set is 13.
     - Time 13 to 14: Only one meeting can be scheduled (e.g., [11-14]).
   - The critical period is from 10 to 14, where we need to manage up to three overlapping meetings simultaneously.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**
   - We have a total of two available rooms.
   - To accommodate the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (three), we would need at least three rooms.

Since only two rooms are available but up to three meetings can overlap during certain periods, it is not possible to schedule all these meetings without conflicts. Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

### Analysis of Overlapping Meetings
1. **Meetings and Their Time Ranges**:
   - Meeting 1: [15-17]
   - Meeting 2: [12-13]
   - Meeting 3: [10-12]

2. **Identifying Overlaps**:
   - Meeting 3 [10-12] overlaps with Meeting 2 [12-13].
   - Meeting 2 [12-13] does not overlap with Meeting 1 [15-17].

3. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 12, there are two meetings happening: Meeting 2 and Meeting 3.
   - At any other point in time (like 10 or 15), only one meeting is scheduled.

4. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings at time 12 is 2, which matches the available rooms.
   - However, if we look at the entire schedule:
     - From 10-12: Meeting 3
     - At 12: Both Meeting 2 and Meeting 3 (2 rooms)
     - From 12-13: Meeting 2
     - From 15-17: Meeting 1

Since the meetings can be scheduled without any time conflict, but we need to consider all overlapping periods:

### Detailed Scheduling:
- **From 10-12**: Only Meeting 3 (1 room)
- **At 12**: Both Meetings 2 and 3 (2 rooms - available)
- **From 12-13**: Meeting 2 (1 room, one from the previous slot can be freed)
- **From 15-17**: Meeting 1 (1 room)

In summary:
- The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.
- We have 2 rooms available, which matches the requirement.

Therefore, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts. However, based on the initial analysis focusing on overlaps and maximum simultaneous meetings, we initially stated "NO" due to an oversight in the explanation. The correct answer is **YES**, as all meetings can be accommodated with the given 2 rooms.

AI Response:
**NO**

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - Meeting 1: [9-11]
   - Meeting 2: [11-12] overlaps with Meeting 1 at time 11.
   - Meeting 3: [13-14] does not overlap with any other meetings.
   - Meeting 4: [13-16] starts after Meeting 3 and ends later, overlapping partially with Meeting 3 from 13 to 14.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - At time 11, Meeting 1 (9-11) and Meeting 2 (11-12) are scheduled.
   - At time 13 to 14, Meeting 3 (13-16) and Meeting 4 (13-14) are scheduled.

Thus, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 at times 11 and 13 to 14.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - With 2 available rooms, we can accommodate all overlapping meetings simultaneously.
   - However, this requires careful scheduling:
     - Meeting 1 (9-11) uses 1 room from 9 to 11.
     - Meeting 2 (11-12) shares the same room with Meeting 1 at 11 and uses a different room from 11 to 12.
     - Meeting 3 (13-16) starts after Meeting 4 (13-14), so both can share one of the rooms from 13 to 14.

Given that all overlapping meetings require at most 2 rooms and there are exactly 2 available rooms, it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts. Therefore, the answer is **YES**.

Time: 1.7s

AI Response:
YES.

### Analysis:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [9-10]
   - Meeting 2: [13-15]

   There are no overlaps between these two meetings as they occur at different time slots.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - Since there are only two meetings and neither of them overlap, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - Available rooms: 2
   - Maximum simultaneous meetings: 2

Given that the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) matches the number of available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

**YES**

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [15-17]
   - Meeting 2: [13-16]

   There is no overlap between the two meetings because they do not share any common time slots.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since there are no overlapping intervals, we can consider each meeting as needing a separate room.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 (one for each meeting).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - We need 2 rooms to accommodate the two non-overlapping meetings.

Since there are exactly enough rooms available to schedule both meetings without conflicts, the answer is **YES**.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 2.7s

AI Response:
**NO**

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - Meeting 1: [9-10]
   - Meeting 2: [10-11]
   - Meeting 3: [11-12]
   - Meeting 4: [9-10]

   - Notice that meetings 1 and 4 overlap (both from 9 to 10), as do meetings 1, 2, and 4 at the start of their time slots.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - At time 10, three meetings are happening simultaneously: [9-10] (Meeting 1 and Meeting 4) and [10-11] (Meeting 2).
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - Since there are only 3 available rooms and at least one time slot has 3 overlapping meetings simultaneously, it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.
   
Thus, with only 3 available rooms, you cannot accommodate the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) that occur during certain time slots.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - The meeting from 9-12 overlaps with the meeting from 12-13, as they share a common time slot (12).

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, which occurs during the period 12-13.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Since there are 3 available rooms and at most 2 meetings can be scheduled simultaneously, all meetings can be accommodated without conflicts.

Thus, with 3 available rooms, it is possible to schedule both meetings [9-12] and [12-13] without any room conflicts.

### Explanation:

1. **Overlap Detection**:
   - Meeting [10-13] overlaps with Meeting [13-16] from time 13 to 13.
   
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At the overlapping point (time 13), two meetings are happening simultaneously: one ending at 13 and another starting at 13.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms, which is sufficient to accommodate the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2).

Since there are exactly 2 rooms available and only 2 meetings occur simultaneously during their overlap period, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 5.9s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - [10-11] and [10-12] both start at 10, so they overlap.
   - [14-16] and [15-16] partially overlap (from 15 to 16).

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 10, we have [10-11] and [10-12], which are two overlapping meetings.
   - At time 15, we have [14-16] and [15-16], which is one meeting.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings at any point in time is 3.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - The problem states that there are only 3 available rooms.
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) matches the number of available rooms, it might initially seem possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.
   - However, we need to ensure that no time slots have more than one meeting per room.

Given this information:
- At time 10, [10-11] and [10-12] overlap. We can place these in two different rooms since they do not conflict with each other.
- At time 15, [14-16] starts and [15-16] overlaps partially. To avoid conflicts, we need to ensure that the room used for [10-12] at time 10 (which ends at 12) can be reassigned by then.

Since both meetings starting at 10 are overlapping and will end at different times (11 and 12), they can share one room until their end. However, from 15 onwards, [14-16] and [15-16] overlap partially, meaning we need to ensure that the room used for [10-12] is freed up by time 15.

Given these conditions:
- At time 10: Two meetings in two rooms.
- By time 11: One meeting ends, leaving one room free and another with [10-12].
- By time 12: The last meeting of the first batch ends, freeing up all but one room.
- At time 15: We need a third room to accommodate [14-16] and [15-16], which cannot be done since only two rooms are available.

Thus, it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts given the constraints.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - The meeting from 9-12 and the meeting from 14-16 do not overlap with each other. They are scheduled at different time slots.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since there are no overlapping meetings, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 1 (either one meeting or none if no meetings are scheduled).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 3 available rooms.
   - Since only one meeting can be scheduled at a time and there are enough rooms available, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Given the constraints of this problem, where overlapping intervals do not conflict and we have more rooms than simultaneous meetings required, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without any issues.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 12:00, both meetings are happening simultaneously (overlap).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There is a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings during the overlap period.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - [10-11] and [11-14] overlap from 11:00 to 14:00.
   - [13-14] and [14-17] overlap from 13:00 to 14:00 (with an additional meeting at 14:00).
   - The meetings [13-14], [14-16], and [14-17] share the same start or end times with other overlapping intervals.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 13:00, we have two meetings starting simultaneously: [13-14] and [14-17].
   - From 13:00 to 14:00, there are three overlapping intervals: [13-14], [14-16], and [14-17].

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - With the maximum of three simultaneous meetings (from 13:00 to 14:00), we need at least 3 rooms, but only 2 rooms are available.

Since the number of required rooms exceeds the available resources, it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Time: 3.8s

AI Response:
NO

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - [9-10] overlaps with [10-11]
   - [10-11] overlaps with [9-10], [10-13], and [11-14]
   - [10-13] overlaps with [9-10], [10-11], and [11-14]
   - [11-14] overlaps with [10-11], [10-13], and [12-15]
   - [12-15] overlaps with [11-14]

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   To find the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, we can use a sweep line algorithm or directly count overlapping intervals.

   Considering all the meeting time ranges and their overlaps:

   - At 10:00 to 11:00, [9-10], [10-11], [10-13] are happening.
   - At 11:00 to 14:00, [10-11], [10-13], and [11-14] are happening.

   The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3 (from 10:00 to 11:00).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have only 2 available rooms.
   - To accommodate the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, we would need at least 3 rooms.

Therefore, with only 2 rooms available and a need for up to 3 simultaneous meetings, all meetings cannot be scheduled without conflicts.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [14-17]
   - Meeting 2: [14-16]
   - Meeting 3: [10-13]

   - Meetings 1 and 2 overlap from 14 to 16.
   - Meetings 1, 2, and 3 do not overlap at all (Meeting 1 starts after Meeting 3 ends).

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 14: Meetings 1 and 2 are happening simultaneously.
   - Maximum simultaneous meetings = 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous overlapping meetings is 2, which is less than the available 3 rooms.

Since the maximum number of simultaneous overlapping meetings (2) does not exceed the number of available rooms (3), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

### Analysis of Overlapping Meetings and Simultaneous Events:

1. **Overlap Detection**:
   - Meeting [14-15] overlaps with [15-17].
   - There is no direct overlap between [11-14] and the other two meetings, but we need to consider if any part of it can be scheduled without conflicts.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 14:00 to 15:00, there are two simultaneous meetings (14-15 and 15-17).
   - This means that at least 2 rooms are required for the period from 14:00 to 15:00.

3. **Comparison with Available Rooms**:
   - We have identified a maximum of 2 simultaneous meetings requiring 2 rooms.
   - Since we have 3 available rooms, it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Given that the overlapping period only requires 2 out of the 3 available rooms and there are no other direct conflicts, the answer is YES. All meetings can be scheduled without conflicts using the provided resources.

### Analysis:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - Meetings [10-11] and [9-11] both start at 10:00 but one ends before the other starts.
   - Meeting [14-17] overlaps with no other meetings as it starts after all earlier meetings end.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At time 10:00, three meetings are happening simultaneously: [9-11], [10-11], and [10-11].
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - We have exactly 3 rooms available.
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) matches the number of available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Given these points, all meetings can indeed be scheduled with the given resources.

### Analysis of Overlapping Meetings and Simultaneous Meetings:

1. **Identifying Overlaps:**
   - [9-11] and [10-12] overlap (from 10-11)
   - [9-11] and [12-13] do not overlap
   - [9-11] and [13-15] do not overlap
   - [10-12] and [11-14] overlap (from 11-12)
   - [11-14] and [13-15] do not overlap

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - During the time range from 9 to 11, there are two meetings ([9-11], [10-12]) that overlap.
   - From 10 to 11, all three rooms can be used simultaneously (meetings [9-11] and [10-12]).
   - At 11, three overlapping meetings exist: [9-11], [10-12], and [11-14].
   - From 13 to 15, there are two meetings ([13-15], [11-14]) that overlap.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - At the peak overlapping time (from 9 to 11), we have three simultaneous meetings.
   - The available rooms are exactly 3.

### Conclusion:
While the maximum number of simultaneous meetings at any point does not exceed the available rooms, there is a critical issue during the period from 9:00 to 11:00 where all three rooms are required simultaneously. Since this peak usage cannot be managed with just 3 rooms without conflicts, it means that the scheduling problem cannot be solved with the given resources.

Thus, **NO**, not all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts given only 3 available rooms.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**
   - [9-12] overlaps with [11-13]
   - [11-13] is a subset of [9-12], so it's effectively part of the same overlapping period.
   - [15-17] does not overlap with any other meeting.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings occurs between 11 and 12, where three meetings are happening:
     - [9-12]
     - [11-13]
     - [15-17]

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**
   - We have identified that up to three meetings can be happening simultaneously.
   - Since we have exactly 3 available rooms, all the simultaneous meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Therefore, it is possible to schedule all these meetings without any room conflicts using the strategies mentioned.

### Analysis of Overlapping Meetings:

1. **Meetings [11-14] and [11-13]**: These two meetings overlap from 11:00 to 13:00.
2. **Meetings [13-16] and [11-13]**: The first of these overlaps with the second from 13:00 to 13:00 (a single point, which does not count as an overlap).
3. **Meeting [9-10]**: This meeting is separate and starts before the overlapping period.

### Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:

- From 11:00 to 13:00, there are two meetings ([11-14] and [11-13]), which means we need at least 2 rooms during this period.
- From 13:00 to 16:00, only one meeting (13-16) is present.

### Comparison to Available Rooms:

- We have 2 available rooms.
- The maximum number of simultaneous meetings that require rooms from 11:00 to 13:00 is 2, which matches the available room count.
- From 13:00 onwards, only one meeting exists and does not conflict with the remaining availability.

Since we have exactly 2 rooms available for the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (from 11:00 to 13:00), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Time: 3.1s

AI Response:
YES

### Explanation:

#### Overlapping Meetings
- **[10-11]** and **[11-13]**: These two meetings partially overlap (11-11) but do not conflict since the meeting starting at 10 ends before the one starting at 11 begins.
- **[11-13]**, **[12-14]**, and **[14-16]**: 
  - [11-13] and [12-14]: Overlap from 12 to 13 (12-13).
  - [12-14] and [14-16]: Do not overlap since the first meeting ends before the second starts.

#### Maximum Simultaneous Meetings
To find the maximum number of simultaneous meetings:
- At time **11**, both [10-11] and [11-13] are happening, totaling 2 meetings.
- At time **12**, [11-13], [12-14], and implicitly considering the end of [10-11], we have 3 simultaneous meetings.

#### Comparison to Available Rooms
- The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
- Since there are **4** available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts, even with the peak requirement of 3 simultaneous meetings.

Problem: [10-13], [14-16] | 2 rooms (max_simultaneous=1)
Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 3.4s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**: 
   - Meeting 1: [10-13]
   - Meeting 2: [14-16]

   There is no overlap between these two meeting time ranges. They are completely separate and distinct from each other.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since there are no overlapping meetings, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings that can occur at any given time is 1 (either Meeting 1 or Meeting 2).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**: 
   - With only 2 available rooms and a maximum of 1 simultaneous meeting requiring room space, all necessary room resources are sufficient.

However, the answer is still NO because the question asks if "all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts." While there are no overlapping meetings, the phrase "without conflicts" might imply that we need to consider if any other constraints (such as time slot availability) prevent scheduling. In this case, since the problem statement does not mention any additional constraints and all required rooms are available for non-overlapping times, it is indeed possible to schedule both meetings without conflicts.

To rephrase the answer with a focus on the given criteria:

YES.

Explanation:
- There is no overlap between the two meeting time ranges [10-13] and [14-16].
- The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 1, which is within the available 2 rooms.

AI Response:
YES.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**: The meetings [14-16] and [15-16] overlap during the time period 15-16.
   
2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**: Considering the overlapping nature, at least one room is required for each meeting from 14 to 16. Specifically, both meetings require a room simultaneously between 15 and 16.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**: With two available rooms, we can accommodate both meetings without conflicts since only one room is needed during the overlapping period (15-16) and another room can be used for the non-overlapping part of each meeting (14-15 or 16 onwards).

Thus, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [11-13]
     - Overlaps with Meeting 2: [10-12] (from time 11 to 12)
     - Does not overlap with Meeting 3: [13-15]
   - Meeting 2: [10-12]
     - Overlaps with Meeting 1: [11-13] (from time 11 to 12)
     - Does not overlap with Meeting 3: [13-15]
   - Meeting 3: [13-15]
     - Does not overlap with Meetings 1 and 2

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 11, both Meeting 1 and Meeting 2 are active.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The model requires at least 2 rooms to accommodate the two overlapping meetings at time 11 (Meetings 1 and 2).
   - Since there are 3 available rooms, this requirement can be met without conflicts.

Thus, all three meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 4.3s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - [9-12] overlaps with both [10-12] and [10-13]
   - [14-16] does not overlap with any other meetings.
   - [14-17] overlaps with [14-16].
   - [10-12] overlaps with [9-12].
   - [10-13] overlaps with [9-12].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - To find the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, we can use a sweep line algorithm or sort the intervals by start time and keep track of active meetings.
   - Sorting the intervals: [9-12], [10-13], [10-12], [14-16], [14-17]
   - As we process these intervals:
     - Adding [9-12] (active: 1)
     - Adding [10-13] (active: 2), [10-12] (conflicts, but only adding one to active set): (active: 2) 
     - Adding [10-12] (already in the active set, no change): (active: 2)
     - Adding [14-16] (active: 3)
     - Adding [14-17] (conflicts with [14-16], but only adding one to active set): (active: 2)

   The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3, which occurs between the intervals [9-12] and [10-13].

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have determined that the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3.
   - With 4 available rooms, it is possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Thus, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts given the available rooms.

### Analysis of Overlapping Meetings
1. **Overlap Detection**:
   - Meeting 1: [13-15]
   - Meeting 2: [12-15]
   - Meeting 3: [13-15]

   All three meetings overlap during the time range [13-15]. Therefore, there are overlapping intervals between these meetings.

### Maximum Simultaneous Meetings
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At any point in time from 12 to 15, at least two of the meetings are active.
   - Specifically, during the interval [13-15], all three meetings overlap.

### Comparison to Available Rooms
3. **Comparison with Available Rooms**:
   - There are only 2 available rooms.
   - However, due to overlapping intervals, we need at least 3 rooms simultaneously (one for each meeting in the overlapping period).

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings that require room allocation is 3, and there are only 2 available rooms, it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Therefore, the answer remains NO. You would need an additional room to accommodate all the overlapping meetings.

### Analysis:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - Meeting 1: [14-16]
   - Meeting 2: [11-13]
   - There is no overlap between these two meeting time ranges. Meeting 1 starts at 14 and ends at 16, while Meeting 2 starts at 11 and ends at 13.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since there are no overlapping meetings, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2 (both can occur at the same time).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need to be scheduled is also 2.

Given these points, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts since there are enough available rooms to accommodate the non-overlapping nature of the meetings.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meeting [10-11] ends at 11.
   - Meeting [11-12] starts at 11 and ends at 12.
   - These two meetings overlap during the time slot from 11:00 to 11:59.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At any given moment between 11:00 and 11:59, both meetings [10-11] and [11-12] are occurring simultaneously.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms.
   - Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings that need to be accommodated is 2, which matches the number of available rooms, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts.

Thus, with 2 available rooms and a requirement for up to 2 simultaneous meetings, it is possible to schedule both [10-11] and [11-12] without any room conflicts.

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Which meetings overlap**:
   - [10-11] and [10-13] both start before 13, indicating that they might overlap.
   - [13-14] starts at 13, which overlaps with the end of [12-13].
   - [12-13], [13-14], and [10-13] are all partially overlapping as they share time slots.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - At 13:00, three meetings are happening simultaneously: [12-13], [13-14], and [10-13]. These meetings cannot be scheduled in the same room without conflicts.

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - With a maximum of three simultaneous meetings at 13:00, but only two rooms are available, it is not possible to schedule all these overlapping meetings without conflicts.

Thus, due to the high number of simultaneous meetings requiring more than the available rooms, it is impossible to schedule all given meetings without conflicts.

Expected: YES | Got: NO | ✗
Time: 4.8s

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - [9-11] and [13-15] do not overlap.
   - [13-15] overlaps with itself, but this is a trivial case since the same meeting can't be scheduled twice in different rooms.
   - [11-14] starts after [9-11] ends and does not overlap with it. However, [11-14] partially overlaps with [13-15].

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 11 to 13, we have the following overlapping meetings: [9-11], [13-15], and [11-14]. This is a maximum of three simultaneous meetings.
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We need at least 3 rooms to accommodate these overlapping meetings during their peak overlap period (11-13), which exactly matches the available number of rooms.

However, when considering all time intervals:
   - At any point in time, we can have up to three simultaneous meetings. This means that if we try to schedule more than one meeting at 13:00, there will be a conflict.
   
Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) is equal to the available rooms and all overlaps are managed correctly, theoretically, it seems feasible.

But upon closer inspection:
   - [9-11] and [13-15] overlap only for 2 hours. 
   - [13-15] and [11-14] partially overlap from 13 to 14.
   
Given that at 13:00, there are two meetings starting ([9-11] ending and [13-15] starting) along with the ongoing meeting at this time period:
   - We need a minimum of 2 rooms for these simultaneous overlaps.

At no point do we exceed the available number of 3 rooms. Therefore, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts under the given constraints.

**Corrected Answer: YES**

All meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts as there are exactly enough rooms to accommodate all overlapping periods.

AI Response:
NO.

Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - [9-10] and [9-11]: These do not overlap.
   - [14-16] and [14-16]: This is a single meeting, but it overlaps with itself.
   - The overlapping interval here does not violate the rule that a meeting ending at time T does NOT conflict with a meeting starting at time T.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 9:00 to 10:00, there are two meetings: [9-10] and [9-11].
   - At time 14:00 to 16:00, there are three overlapping meetings: [14-16], [14-16], and another meeting starting at the same time.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings during any time slot is 3.
   - Since only 2 rooms are available, it is not possible to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

Therefore, with only 2 rooms available, it is impossible to schedule all the given meetings simultaneously, and a conflict exists.

### Analysis:

1. **Identifying Overlapping Meetings**:
   - Meeting 1: [11-13]
   - Meeting 2: [13-16]
     - Overlaps with Meeting 1 (at 13)
   - Meeting 3: [12-15]
     - Overlaps with Meeting 1 (from 12 to 13), and overlaps partially with Meeting 2 (from 14 to 15)
   - Meeting 4: [9-10]
     - No overlap with any other meeting

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 13, we have the following meetings overlapping simultaneously:
     - Meeting 1: [11-13] ends
     - Meeting 2: [13-16] starts and overlaps until 15
     - Meeting 3: [12-15] partially overlaps from 14 to 15

   Therefore, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3 (Meetings 2, 3 at 14 and 15).

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous overlapping meetings is 3.

Since the number of available rooms (3) matches the maximum number of simultaneous overlapping meetings required (3), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

   None of the provided meetings overlap with each other.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since there are no overlapping meetings, the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is simply the number of independent time slots available.
   - In this case, both meetings can occur simultaneously but in different rooms since they do not conflict with one another.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - Available rooms: 3
   - Required rooms: 2 (one for each meeting)

Since there are 3 available rooms and only 2 meetings that can be scheduled without any overlap, all meetings can indeed be scheduled without conflicts, ensuring that the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is managed within the room availability.

   - At 13:00 to 14:00, the following meetings are scheduled: [13-16], [13-15], and [13-16].
     - This results in a maximum of three simultaneous meetings during this time slot.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - There are four available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings (three) is less than or equal to the number of available rooms (four).

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (three) does not exceed the number of available rooms (four), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

AI Response:
**NO**

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap:**
   - Meeting 1: [14-15]
   - Meeting 2: [11-13] (No overlap)
   - Meeting 3: [15-18]
   - Meeting 4: [14-15] (Overlaps with Meeting 1 and Meeting 3)
   - Meeting 5: [13-16] (Overlaps with Meeting 3)

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:**
   - To find the maximum number of simultaneous meetings, we need to identify intervals that overlap.
   - The overlapping periods are:
     - From 14:00 to 15:00: Meetings [14-15], [14-15] (2 meetings)
     - From 15:00 to 16:00: Meetings [15-18], [13-16], [14-15] (3 meetings, but only [15-18] and [13-16] overlap at this exact moment)

   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 3, occurring from 15:00 to 16:00.

3. **Comparison to Available Rooms:**
   - We have 3 available rooms.
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings during any period is 3, which matches the number of available rooms exactly.

However, the critical issue here is that even though the maximum number of simultaneous meetings can be handled by the available rooms at their peak times, we must ensure that no room is overbooked for any time slot. Specifically:

- From 15:00 to 16:00, Meetings [15-18], [13-16], and one of [14-15] are scheduled.
- This means all three rooms will be occupied from 15:00 to 16:00.

Therefore, while the maximum number of simultaneous meetings is exactly equal to the available rooms, this does not guarantee that no single room is overbooked at any time. Since the overlapping periods require using all three rooms simultaneously for a short period, it indicates that the scheduling cannot be done without conflicts if we strictly follow the given constraints.

Thus, **NO**, all meetings cannot be scheduled without conflicts based on the provided information and available resources.

Explanation:
1. **Which meetings overlap**: 
   - Meeting [9-12] and meeting [15-16] do not overlap because they are scheduled at different time intervals.

2. **Maximum simultaneous meetings**:
   - The maximum number of simultaneous meetings is 2, as both meetings occur at non-overlapping times (one in the morning from 9 to 12 and one in the afternoon from 15 to 16).

3. **Comparison to available rooms**:
   - There are 2 available rooms, which is exactly the number needed for the 2 simultaneous meetings.

Since there are no overlapping meetings and the number of available rooms matches the maximum number of simultaneous meetings required, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

   - Meeting 3: [13-15]

   - Meeting 2 overlaps with Meeting 1 (from 11 to 12).
   - No other meetings overlap directly.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - At time 11, Meeting 1 and Meeting 2 are occurring simultaneously.
   - At time 13, Meeting 1 and Meeting 3 are occurring simultaneously.

### Explanation:

1. **Which Meetings Overlap**:
   - The meetings [10-11] and [10-11] exactly match, meaning they start and end at the same times. Therefore, these two meetings definitely overlap.

2. **Maximum Simultaneous Meetings**:
   - Since both meetings occur during the exact same time interval (10:00 to 11:00), they are considered as one simultaneous meeting in terms of room allocation.
   
3. **Comparison to Available Rooms**:
   - With only two meetings happening simultaneously and an availability of 3 rooms, all required resources are covered.

Given that there is no conflict between the overlapping intervals and more than enough rooms available (2 out of 3), it is possible to schedule both meetings without conflicts.
