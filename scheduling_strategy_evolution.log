OLD STRATEGY:
To determine if meetings can be scheduled:
1. Check which meetings overlap in time
2. Count the maximum number of meetings happening at the same time
3. If max_simultaneous <= num_rooms: YES (solvable)
4. If max_simultaneous > num_rooms: NO (impossible)

Key insight: A meeting ending at time T does NOT conflict with a meeting starting at time T.

NEW STRATEGY:
To effectively address the meeting room allocation challenges based on the journal entries provided, we can extract and formulate several key scheduling strategies. These focus on accurately counting simultaneous meetings, detecting time overlaps, handling edge cases, and determining solvability rules.

### 1. Counting Simultaneous Meetings Correctly

- **Actionable Steps:**
  - Simulate a wide range of meeting time intervals, including overlapping and non-overlapping cases.
  - Evaluate the system's performance on problems involving multiple overlaps, boundary conditions, and small resource margins.

### 4. Solvability Determination Rules

### Additional Strategies

**Strategy: Room Allocation Based on Temporal Proximity**
- **Description:** Develop a strategy that dynamically allocates rooms based on the temporal proximity of meetings.
- **Actionable Steps:**
  - Start assigning rooms from the earliest and latest intervals first to ensure efficient resource utilization.
  - Use dynamic programming or graph theory-based approaches to optimize room allocation.

**Strategy: Boundary Condition Management**
- **Description:** Ensure the system correctly identifies non-conflicting scenarios where meetings start or end at the same time but in different rooms.
- **Actionable Steps:**
  - Implement checks that consider overlapping boundaries only when they are in the same meeting, and not as a conflict between different meetings.

### Summary

By focusing on these strategies, you can significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of your meeting room allocation system:

1. **Dynamic Partitioning of Time Intervals** to handle simultaneous meetings effectively.

NEW STRATEGY:
Based on the journal entries provided, here are some effective scheduling strategies to address the most critical issues:

### Counting Simultaneous Meetings Correctly

1. **Use Interval Trees or Segment Trees**:
   - Implement an interval tree (or segment tree) data structure to manage and query overlapping time ranges efficiently.
   - This allows for quick insertion, deletion, and querying of intervals, ensuring that simultaneous meetings are counted accurately.

2. **Dynamic Programming with Overlapping Intervals**:
   - Use dynamic programming techniques like the Longest Non-Overlapping Interval (LNVI) or interval partitioning to count overlapping meeting intervals.
   - For instance, create a DP table where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of rooms required for the first `i` meetings.

### Detect Time Overlaps

1. **Sort and Merge Intervals**:
   - Sort all meeting time ranges by their start times.
   - Use a merge function to identify overlapping intervals. This can be achieved using a sweep line algorithm or a priority queue to efficiently detect overlaps.

2. **Graph Algorithms for Room Allocation**:
   - Construct a graph where nodes represent meetings and edges represent room conflicts.
   - Apply algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the minimum number of rooms required, ensuring no conflicts exist between overlapping intervals.

### Edge Cases

1. **Handling Multiple Overlapping Meetings**:
   - Develop a robust method for detecting and managing multiple overlapping meetings.
   - Use interval trees to quickly identify overlapping periods and ensure that they are properly accounted for in room allocations.

2. **Exact Room Count Scenarios**:
   - Implement precise algorithms to determine the exact number of rooms needed, especially when dealing with close temporal overlaps.
   - Break down larger time ranges into smaller intervals to facilitate more accurate scheduling.

3. **Minimal Overlap Scenarios**:
   - Ensure that even minimal overlap scenarios are accurately assessed by breaking down large intervals and considering each small segment individually.

### Solvability Determination Rules

1. **Feasibility Check with Interval Trees**:
   - Use interval trees to perform a feasibility check for room allocations.
   - For each meeting, check if there is a valid room slot available that does not conflict with existing meetings.

2. **Backtracking or Recursive Approach**:
   - Implement a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible combinations of meeting assignments and their impacts on room availability.
   - This ensures that the model correctly handles complex temporal relationships and avoids incorrect conclusions.

3. **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**:
   - Formulate the problem as a CSP where variables represent rooms, constraints represent time slot conflicts, and values are potential meeting assignments.
   - Solve the CSP using techniques like constraint propagation or search algorithms to find valid room allocations.

### Actionable Strategies

1. **Implement Interval Trees**:
   - Use an interval tree data structure to manage overlapping intervals efficiently.
   - Ensure that each insertion and query operation is handled optimally for accurate simultaneous meeting counts.

2. **Dynamic Programming for Overlapping Intervals**:
   - Develop a DP table or use dynamic programming techniques to count the number of rooms required for overlapping intervals effectively.
   - This ensures that all possible combinations are evaluated without redundancy.

3. **Graph-Based Room Allocation**:
   - Construct and analyze a graph where nodes represent meetings and edges represent room conflicts.
   - Use graph algorithms like DFS, BFS, or CSP solving techniques to find valid room allocations.

4. **Solve with Backtracking**:
   - Implement a backtracking approach to explore all possible meeting assignments.
   - This ensures that the model accurately handles complex temporal relationships and avoids incorrect conclusions due to overlapping intervals.

By implementing these strategies, you can significantly improve the accuracy of your scheduling model in handling complex temporal relationships and ensuring correct room allocations.
