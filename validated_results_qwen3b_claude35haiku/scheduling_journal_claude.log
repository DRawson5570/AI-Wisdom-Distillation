AI REFLECTION:
Journal Entry: Batch 8 Meeting Room Allocation Analysis

Patterns in Correct Answers:
- Successful cases seem to involve simpler overlap scenarios
- Correct solutions appear when the maximum simultaneous meeting overlap is less than or equal to available rooms
- Simple, non-complex time range intersections were more likely to be correctly resolved

Mistake Patterns:
1. Complexity Handling
- The algorithm struggles with multiple overlapping time ranges
- More intricate intersection scenarios (multiple meetings with partial overlaps) consistently led to incorrect results
- Seems to have difficulty tracking cumulative room occupancy across different time segments

2. Overlap Calculation Weakness
- Likely using an overly simplistic overlap detection mechanism
- Not effectively counting concurrent meetings at each time point
- Potential issue with how intersecting time ranges are processed

Edge Cases Requiring Attention:
- Meetings with partial time overlaps
- Scenarios with multiple meetings starting/ending at similar times
- Complex intersection patterns where meetings partially cover each other
- Situations with high meeting density in specific time ranges

Strategic Improvement Insights:
1. Implement a robust concurrent meeting counting algorithm
- Track meeting start and end points separately
- Use an event-based approach to count simultaneous meetings
- Dynamically update room occupancy at each time point

2. Develop a more nuanced intersection detection method
- Consider each time point's total room requirements
- Create a cumulative occupancy tracking mechanism
- Ensure accurate counting of overlapping meetings

3. Algorithmic Refinement
- Use a timeline-based approach
- Sort and process meetings chronologically
- Maintain a running count of active meetings
- Compare against available room count at each stage

Recommended Next Steps:
- Redesign overlap detection logic
- Implement comprehensive time range intersection tracking
- Create a more granular room allocation verification method
- Focus on precise concurrent meeting calculation

Conclusion:
The current approach lacks the sophistication needed to handle complex meeting scheduling scenarios. A fundamental redesign focusing on precise, point-by-point room occupancy tracking is essential for improving performance.
