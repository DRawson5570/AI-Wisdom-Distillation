Problem: [10-13], [12-14], [14-16] | 3 rooms (max_simultaneous=2)
Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 3.2s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
- Overlapping meetings:
  [10-13] overlaps with [12-14]
  [12-14] overlaps with [10-13] and [14-16]

- Maximum simultaneous meetings:
  At time 12-13: 2 meetings overlap ([10-13] and [12-14])
  At time 13-14: 2 meetings overlap ([12-14])

- Available rooms: 3
- Maximum simultaneous meetings: 2

Since 2 (max simultaneous meetings) ≤ 3 (available rooms), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Current Strategy Being Used:
To determine if meetings can be scheduled:
1. Check which meetings overlap in time
2. Count the maximum number of meetings happening at the same time
3. If max_simultaneous <= num_rooms: YES (solvable)
4. If max_simultaneous > num_rooms: NO (impossible)

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 3.5s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
- Overlapping meetings:
  [10-11] and [13-15] do NOT overlap
  [14-17] and [13-15] DO overlap

- Maximum simultaneous meetings:
  At time 14-15, 2 meetings are happening simultaneously
    - [13-15]
    - [14-17]

- Available rooms (3) > Maximum simultaneous meetings (2)
  Therefore, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts

The key is that the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (2) is less than the number of available rooms (3), so a valid room assignment is possible.

To determine if meetings can be scheduled:
1. Check which meetings overlap in time
2. Count the maximum number of meetings happening at the same time

AI Response:
Let's solve this systematically:

1. Overlap Analysis:
- [12-15] overlaps with [12-14]
- [12-15] overlaps with [13-15]
- [12-14] overlaps with [13-15]

2. Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:
At time 13-14, we have 3 meetings simultaneously:
- [12-15]
- [12-14]
- [13-15]

3. Available Rooms vs Simultaneous Meetings:
- Maximum simultaneous meetings: 3
- Available rooms: 4

4. Conclusion:
YES, all meetings can be scheduled.

Explanation: Although 3 meetings overlap at the peak time (13-14), we have 4 rooms available, which is sufficient to accommodate these simultaneous meetings without conflict.

Time: 2.9s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
- Meetings [14-15] and [15-18] do NOT overlap
  - [14-15] ends exactly when [15-18] starts
  - Per problem rules, this is NOT a conflict
- Maximum simultaneous meetings = 1
- Available rooms = 2
- Since 1 ≤ 2, all meetings can be scheduled

The key is that meetings ending and starting at the same time are considered non-conflicting, so these two meetings can be scheduled in separate rooms.

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
- Overlapping meetings:
  [14-16] overlaps with [15-16]
  [15-16] overlaps with [14-16] and [15-18]
  [15-18] overlaps with [15-16]
  [15-16] overlaps with multiple meetings

- Maximum simultaneous meetings:
  At time 15, there are 3 meetings happening simultaneously:
  [14-16], [15-16], [15-18]

- Room comparison:
  3 simultaneous meetings
  2 available rooms
  3 > 2, so normally this would be impossible

However, the problem statement specifies that a meeting ending at time T does NOT conflict with a meeting starting at time T.

This means at time 16, one meeting ends, freeing up a room for another meeting.

Therefore, with careful scheduling, all meetings CAN be accommodated using the 2 available rooms.

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 2.6s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
- Meetings [15-18] and [9-10] do NOT overlap at all
- Maximum simultaneous meetings = 1 (at any given time)
- Available rooms = 3
- Since 1 ≤ 3, all meetings can be scheduled without conflict

Detailed overlap check:
- [9-10] occurs entirely before [15-18]
- No time periods have more than 1 meeting happening simultaneously
- Plenty of rooms available to accommodate these meetings

Current Strategy Being Used:
To determine if meetings can be scheduled:
1. Check which meetings overlap in time
2. Count the maximum number of meetings happening at the same time
3. If max_simultaneous <= num_rooms: YES (solvable)
4. If max_simultaneous > num_rooms: NO (impossible)

AI Response:
Let's solve this systematically:

1. Overlap Analysis:
- [14-17] overlaps with [15-18]
- [14-17] overlaps with another [14-17]
- [10-12] and [12-13] do not overlap with other meetings

2. Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:
At time 15-17, we have:
- [14-17]
- [15-18]
- [14-17]
This means 3 meetings are happening simultaneously

3. Room Comparison:
- Maximum simultaneous meetings: 3
- Available rooms: 3

4. Decision:
YES, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Explanation: The peak simultaneous meeting count (3) exactly matches the number of available rooms, so every meeting can be assigned a room without overlap.

  At time 15-16: 1 meeting ([15-16])

- Maximum simultaneous meetings = 2
- Available rooms = 3

Since max simultaneous meetings (2) ≤ available rooms (3), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Current Strategy Being Used:
To determine if meetings can be scheduled:
1. Check which meetings overlap in time
2. Count the maximum number of meetings happening at the same time
3. If max_simultaneous <= num_rooms: YES (solvable)
4. If max_simultaneous > num_rooms: NO (impossible)

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 3.3s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
- Overlapping meetings:
  [10-12] overlaps with [11-13]
  [10-12] overlaps with [10-11]
  [11-13] overlaps with [10-11]

- Maximum simultaneous meetings:
  At time 11, 3 meetings are happening simultaneously:
  [10-12], [11-13], [10-11]

- Room comparison:
  3 simultaneous meetings require 3 rooms
  Only 2 rooms are available

Therefore, NO, these meetings CANNOT be scheduled without conflicts.

Correction: My previous answer was NO, not YES. The meetings cannot be scheduled because the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exceeds the number of available rooms (2).

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 3.7s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
- Meetings overlap at these critical time points:
  * 13-14: 4 meetings are concurrent
    - [11-14]
    - [13-16]
    - [10-12]
    - [13-14]

- Maximum simultaneous meetings: 4
- Available rooms: 4

Since the maximum number of concurrent meetings (4) exactly matches the number of available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts. The algorithm would allocate one room to each overlapping meeting during the peak occupancy period of 13-14.

Key observations:
- Peak time interval is 13-14
- Total concurrent meetings = 4
- Room availability = 4
- Perfect match between meeting demand and room supply

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 3.7s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
- At time 10, there are 3 meetings simultaneously:
  1. [10-12]
  2. [10-11]
  3. [10-11]

- Maximum simultaneous meetings: 3
- Available rooms: 3

The algorithm would track:
- At time 10: 3 meetings start
- At time 11: 2 meetings end
- At time 12: 1 meeting ends

Since the maximum simultaneous meetings (3) exactly matches the available rooms (3), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

The key points are:
- Precise point-in-time tracking
- Counting concurrent meetings
- Matching against room availability

The solution leverages the time point tracking approach, processing events sequentially and dynamically calculating room occupancy.

AI Response:
Let's solve this systematically:

1. Chronological Event Tracking:
   - 9: [9-11], [9-12] start (+2 meetings)
   - 10: [10-12], [10-13] start (+2 more meetings, total 4)
   - 11: [9-11], [10-12] end (-2 meetings, total 2)
   - 12: [9-12], [10-13] end (-2 meetings, total 0)
   - 14: [14-17] start (+1 meeting)
   - 15: [15-17] start (+1 meeting, total 2)
   - 17: [14-17], [15-17] end (back to 0 meetings)

2. Maximum Simultaneous Meetings: 4
3. Available Rooms: 3

ANSWER: NO

Explanation:
- At time point 10, there are 4 simultaneous meetings
- This exceeds the available room count of 3
- Specifically, meetings [9-11], [9-12], [10-12], [10-13] overlap
- Requires 4 rooms, but only 3 are available
- Therefore, not all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts

Time: 4.1s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
- Meetings overlap as follows:
  [10-13] overlaps with [11-14]
  [11-14] overlaps with [10-13] and [12-15]
  [12-15] overlaps with [11-14] and [14-16]

- Maximum simultaneous meetings calculation:
  10-11: 1 meeting
  11-12: 2 meetings
  12-13: 3 meetings
  13-14: 3 meetings
  14-15: 2 meetings
  15-16: 1 meeting

- Peak simultaneous meetings: 3
- Available rooms: 3

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) exactly matches the number of available rooms, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

The algorithm would track the events chronologically, incrementing/decrementing meeting count at each time point, and verify that the peak occupancy never exceeds room availability.

Time: 4.3s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
- Meetings with overlaps:
  [13-15], [14-17], [14-16], [14-15] have significant intersections

- Maximum simultaneous meetings calculation:
  At time point 14, there are 4 meetings active simultaneously:
  - [13-15]
  - [14-17]
  - [14-16]
  - [14-15]

- Room requirement vs availability:
  4 simultaneous meetings require exactly 4 rooms
  4 rooms are available

The algorithm would track:
- Start events: +1 room
- End events: -1 room
- Peak occupancy: 4 rooms
- Available rooms: 4

Since the maximum simultaneous meetings (4) exactly matches the available rooms (4), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Expected: NO | Got: YES | ✗
Time: 3.8s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
- Peak overlap occurs at time 15, with 4 meetings simultaneously:
  [15-18], [15-17], [15-16], [12-15]
- Maximum concurrent meetings: 4
- Available rooms: 2
- 4 meetings > 2 rooms, so conflicts exist

Detailed Breakdown:
- Time 15 is the critical point
- 4 meetings intersect at this time point
- Room requirement (4) exceeds available rooms (2)
- Therefore, scheduling is impossible without additional rooms

Conflict Detection:
- [15-18] overlaps with [15-17], [15-16], [12-15]
- These 4 meetings cannot be accommodated in 2 rooms

Conclusion: Scheduling is NOT possible with the given constraints.

Expected: NO | Got: YES | ✗
Time: 3.7s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
- Meetings [9-12] and [10-13] overlap
- At peak (10-12), 3 meetings are active:
  * First [9-12] meeting
  * Second [9-12] meeting
  * [10-13] meeting
- Total simultaneous meetings: 3
- Available rooms: 2
- Exceeds room capacity by 1 meeting

Therefore, not all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Detailed Overlap Analysis:
- Time interval 10-12 is critical point
- 3 meetings compete for 2 rooms
- 1 meeting must be unscheduled or rescheduled

Scheduling Impossibility Confirmed.

Explanation:
- Meetings [12-15] and [12-13] overlap at 12-13
- Meeting [10-12] does not conflict with others
- Meeting [15-16] is separate from other meetings

Maximum simultaneous meetings:

AI Response:
Let's solve this systematically:

1. Create timeline of events:
   9: Start [9-12]
   10: Start [10-12]
   11: Start [11-14]
   12: Start [12-13], Start [12-13]
   13: End [12-13], End [12-13]
   14: End [11-14]

2. Track simultaneous meetings:
   At 12:00, we have 4 meetings simultaneously:
   - [9-12]
   - [10-12]
   - [11-14]
   - [12-13]
   - [12-13]

3. Maximum concurrent meetings: 5
   Available rooms: 2

NO

Explanation:
- At peak time (12:00), 5 meetings are happening concurrently
- Only 2 rooms are available
- 3 meetings cannot be accommodated
- Scheduling is impossible without additional rooms or rescheduling

The key bottleneck is the 12:00 time point, where meeting overlap exceeds room capacity.

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 3.3s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
- Meetings overlap as follows:
  [9-10]: 1 meeting
  [9-11]: 2 meetings
  [11-14]: 2 meetings
  [12-15]: 2 meetings

- Maximum simultaneous meetings: 2
- Available rooms: 3

Since the maximum number of concurrent meetings (2) is less than the available rooms (3), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts. The algorithm would track the time points, count concurrent meetings at each interval, and confirm that no point exceeds the room capacity.

Key observation: At no point do more than 2 meetings occur simultaneously, which is comfortably within the 3-room limit.

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
- Meetings [11-12], [11-13], and [11-14] overlap simultaneously
- Maximum simultaneous meetings at peak: 3 meetings
- Available rooms: 3
- Since simultaneous meetings (3) exactly match available rooms (3), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts

Detailed overlap breakdown:
- At time 11: [11-12], [11-13], [11-14] are active (3 meetings)
- At time 12: [11-13], [11-14] remain active (2 meetings)
- At time 13: [11-14] remains active (1 meeting)
- At time 14-15: No overlap
- At time 15-18: [15-18] is the only active meeting

The scheduling is feasible because the maximum concurrent meeting count (3) does not exceed the available room count (3).

Explanation:
- Meetings [9-11] and [11-12] overlap
- Meeting [12-15] overlaps with [11-12]
- Maximum simultaneous meetings at any point: 2 rooms
- Available rooms: 2
- All meetings can be accommodated without conflicts

Detailed timeline:
- 9-11: 1st meeting occupies a room
- 11-12: 2nd meeting starts, no conflict
- 12-15: 3rd meeting starts, still within room capacity

The algorithm would track:
- At 9: 1 room occupied
- At 11: 2 rooms occupied
- At 12: 2 rooms occupied
- At 15: 0 rooms occupied

   - [10-13]
   - [11-14]
   - [12-14]
   - [13-15]
   - [15-16]

ANSWER: NO

Explanation:
- At peak times (12-13), 3 meetings are simultaneously active
- Only 2 rooms are available
- This creates an unresolvable scheduling conflict
- At least one meeting cannot be accommodated without violating room constraints

The algorithm would detect 3 concurrent meetings exceeding the 2-room limit, making the schedule impossible.

Expected: YES | Got: YES | ✓
Time: 3.7s

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
- Meetings overlap as follows:
  [10-12]: First meeting
  [12-13]: Second meeting partially overlaps with first
  [15-17]: Third meeting has no overlap with previous meetings

- Maximum simultaneous meetings calculation:
  At 12: 2 meetings active (10-12 and 12-13)
  At other times: 1 or fewer meetings active

- Available rooms (2) exceed maximum simultaneous meetings (2)

Therefore, all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

Verification steps:
1. Track meeting start/end points
2. Count concurrent meetings
3. Compare to room availability
4. Confirm total rooms (2) sufficient for peak occupancy (2)

3. Maximum Simultaneous Meetings: 3

4. Available Rooms: 2

ANSWER: NO

Explanation:
- At multiple time points (10, 11, 12), 3 meetings are simultaneously active
- This exceeds the available room count of 2
- Therefore, not all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts
- Specifically, at least one meeting will require a third room, which is unavailable

The key conflict occurs during the peak overlap periods where 3 meetings are concurrently scheduled, but only 2 rooms are available.

AI Response:
YES

Explanation:
- Meetings overlap as follows:
  [9-12] and [10-12] overlap
  [14-16] and [14-17] overlap
  [10-12] and [10-13] overlap

- Maximum simultaneous meetings analysis:
  At time 10-12: 3 meetings active simultaneously
  At time 14-16: 2 meetings active simultaneously

- Room requirement calculation:
  Peak concurrent meetings = 3
  Available rooms = 4

Since the maximum number of simultaneous meetings (3) is less than the available rooms (4), all meetings can be scheduled without conflicts.

The algorithm would track:
- 9-10: 1 meeting
- 10-12: 3 meetings
- 12-13: 2 meetings
- 14-16: 2 meetings
- 16-17: 1 meeting
