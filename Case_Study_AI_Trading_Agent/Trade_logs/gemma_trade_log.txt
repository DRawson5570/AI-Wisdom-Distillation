Reasoning: The system has confirmed a SHORT breakout with the current close at 90.09100 being lower than Bar-1 HA Low of 90.24800, indicating strong bearish momentum. Supporting indicators include an oversold RSI and a bullish cross in stochastic suggesting reversal potential, alongside high volume that reinforces this setup's validity. The presence of a bearish engulfing pattern corroborates the trend change to downward.
