Reasoning: The pre-calculated result shows a SHORT BREAKOUT CONFIRMED as the current close (84.60000) is below Bar-1 HA Low (84.79300).

Entry: 132.222 | SL: 135.50900000000001 | TP: 127.2915
Balance: $6,345.31
Reasoning: The pre-calculated status indicates a SHORT BREAKOUT CONFIRMED with the current close below Bar-1 HA Low, signaling strong short entry potential. The Heikin Ashi color change to red and ADX showing a strong trend corroborate this action. Despite high volume typically indicating strength in reversals, RSI being above 70 suggests overbought conditions supporting a potential downward move.

Entry: 90.303 | SL: 90.17 | TP: 90.5025

Reasoning: System confirmed LONG breakout above Bar-1 HA High. RSI at 45 suggests room to run upward and is still in the bullish zone. MACD is turning positive, indicating a potential continuation of the uptrend. The strong 5-bar uptrend with increasing volume further supports this entry. However, I am cautious as we are approaching the 20-period EMA (97.1), where a reversal could occur. If stochastic starts to overextend and enters the overbought zone, that would be a stronger signal for entering long. There is some risk of overextension but the setup appears well-supported by both RSI and MACD indicators.
