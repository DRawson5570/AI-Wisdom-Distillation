        "prediction_text": "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### 1. Object Properties:\n   - **Object Type**: Soda Can (deformable, liquid inside)\n   - **Weight**: Approximately 0.5 kg\n   - **Fragility**: Liquid inside can cause it to be fragile.\n   - **Shape**: Circular with a lid.\n   - **Contents**: Liquids like soda or water.\n\n#### 2. Force Evaluation:\n   - **Grip Type**: Precision Grip (3.439 N)\n     - This is within the \"Deformable\" category limit of 2-5N force, so it should be safe for a deformable object.\n   - **Movement Speed**: Fast\n     - The fast motion (>0.5 m/s) with fragile/liquid objects can cause them to tip over or slosh out.\n\n#### 3. Environmental Constraints:\n   - **Moisture/Condensation Present**: Yes, which could affect the friction and stability of the object.\n   - **Smooth Packaging Material**: This suggests a low-friction surface, but it doesn't directly impact the force limits for this scenario.\n\n#### 4. Decision Process:\n\n1. Classify Object Type: Soda can is deformable with liquid inside, so it falls into the \"Deformable\" category.\n2. Check Force vs Limit:\n   - Grip Force (3.439 N) is within the limit of 2-5N for a deformable object",
