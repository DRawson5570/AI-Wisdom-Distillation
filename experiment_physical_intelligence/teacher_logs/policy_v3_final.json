Core Principles\n\n### Principle 1: Prioritize Stability Over Speed\nIn tasks involving physical manipulation, prioritize stability over speed to ensure controlled and safe operations.\n\n### Principle 2: Consider Object Properties Before Acting\nAlways consider the physical properties of objects (e.g., shape, material) before initiating any action to prevent damage or failure.\n\n### Principle 3: Use Sensors for Real-Time Monitoring\nImplement sensors and visual cues to monitor object stability and detect anomalies in real-time to ensure safe operations.\n\n## 2. Object Classification Rules\n\n### Object Categories:\n- **Fragile**: Objects that can break easily (e.g., glass, ceramics).\n- **Heavy**: Objects with significant mass.\n- **Deformable**: Objects that can be deformed or compressed (e.g., soft plastics, foam).\n- **Rolling**: Objects designed to roll (e.g., wheels, balls).\n- **Liquid-Filled**: Containers filled with liquids.\n\n### Classification Methods:\n1. **Visual Inspection**:\n   - **Fragile**: Look for transparent materials, sharp edges, or any signs of fragility.\n   - **Heavy**: Check the overall size and weight distribution.\n   - **Deformable**: Observe softness or flexibility.\n   - **Rolling**: Identify circular shapes with smooth surfaces.\n   - **Liquid-Filled**: Inspect containers that are transparent or have liquid-like properties.\n\n2. **Sensor-Based Classification**:\n   - **Fragile**: Use force sensors to detect high resistance or brittleness.\n   - **Heavy**: Measure weight using load cells.\n   - **Deformable**: Monitor deformation with strain gauges.\n   - **Rolling**: Detect rolling motion with accelerometers or wheel encoders.\n   - **Liquid-Filled**: Identify fluid properties through pressure sensors and visual inspection.\n\n## 3. Heuristics by Category\n\n### Fragile Objects\n- **Recommended Grip Strategy**: Precision grip to minimize force application.\n- **Force Range**: Less than 5 N (adjust based on object size).\n- **Movement Speed**: Slow, controlled movements \u22640.1 m/s.\n- **Key Failure Modes**: Cracking or breaking due to excessive force.\n- **Predictive Checks**:\n  - Acceleration sensors for sudden changes in speed.\n  - Force oscillation amplitude to detect instability.\n\n### Heavy Objects\n- **Recommended Grip Strategy**: Power grip with high friction.\n- **Force Range**: 10-20 N (adjust based on object size and weight).\n- **Movement Speed**: Moderate, controlled movements \u22640.5 m/s.\n- **Key Failure Modes**: Slippage or damage due to uneven surfaces.\n- **Predictive Checks**:\n  - Load cell readings for excessive force.\n  - Tilt sensors to detect instability.\n\n### Deformable Objects\n- **Recommended Grip Strategy**: Soft grip with slight pressure.\n- **Force Range**: 2-5 N (adjust based on object size and deformability).\n- **Movement Speed**: Slow, controlled movements \u22640.1 m/s.\n- **Key Failure Modes**: Permanent deformation or collapse.\n- **Predictive Checks**:\n  - Strain gauge readings for excessive deformation.\n  - Visual inspection for signs of compression.\n\n### Rolling Objects\n- **Recommended Grip Strategy**: Wheel-specific grip to prevent rolling.\n- **Force Range**: Minimal force (\u22641 N) to avoid rolling.\n- **Movement Speed**: Slow, controlled movements \u22640.2 m/s.\n- **Key Failure Modes**: Damage from uneven surfaces or obstacles.\n- **Predictive Checks**:\n  - Accelerometer readings for unexpected motion.\n  - Visual inspection for signs of wheel engagement.\n\n### Liquid-Filled Containers\n- **Recommended Grip Strategy**: Secure grip with minimal force.\n- **Force Range**: \u22645 N (adjust based on container size).\n- **Movement Speed**: Slow, controlled movements \u22640.1 m/s.\n- **Key Failure Modes**: Liquid sloshing or container damage due to acceleration.\n- **Predictive Checks**:\n  - Acceleration sensors for sudden changes in speed.\n  - Pressure sensor readings for excessive force.\n\n## 4. Failure Recovery Strategies\n\n### General Steps:\n1. **Identify the Anomaly**: Use real-time sensor data to detect deviations from expected behavior.\n2. **Triage Action**: Determine if the anomaly is critical (e.g., object damage) or non-critical (e.g., minor deformation).\n3. **Adjust Strategy**:\n   - For critical anomalies, stop and re-evaluate the grip and movement strategy.\n   - For non-critical anomalies, continue with adjusted parameters to minimize further damage.\n\n### Specific Actions:\n- **Critical Anomalies**: \n  - Stop all movements immediately.\n  - Re-classify the object based on new sensor data.\n  - Adjust grip and movement speed accordingly.\n- **Non-Critical Anomalies**:\n  - Slow down or stop the current movement.\n  - Monitor the anomaly to ensure it does not worsen.\n  - Continue with adjusted parameters if the anomaly stabilizes.\n\n## 5. Confidence Assessment\n\n### Confidence Level: Intermediate\nThis policy is designed for intermediate systems and can be refined based on real-world performance data and additional training. It provides a structured approach to handling various object categories but may require further customization for specific applications.\n\n---\n\nBy following this manual, robotic systems can improve their ability to handle physical manipulation tasks with greater reliability and safety. Regular updates and refinements will ensure that the policy remains effective as new technologies and use cases emerge.",
