📊 RESULTS SUMMARY
================================================================================

LoRA Model (opt-125m): 0.0% (0/19)

📊 Comparison with earlier results:
   Baseline (qwen2.5:1.5b no strategy):  84.2% (16/19)
   Verbose manual (5,367 chars):         57.9% (11/19)
   Minimal manual (567 chars):           68.4% (13/19)
   LoRA (opt-125m + physics adapter):    0.0% (0/19)

⚠️  LoRA model underperforming. Possible reasons:
   - Base model (opt-125m) too small for physics reasoning
   - Training dataset too small (30 examples)
   - Need more epochs or better hyperparameters
