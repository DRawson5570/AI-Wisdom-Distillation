# Journal Targeting Matrix

## Candidate Venues

### 1) AI Safety / Alignment Focus
- Fit: High for operational evaluation frameworks and adversarial behavior studies
- Typical requirements: reproducibility package, explicit limitations, conservative claims
- Manuscript adaptation: keep consciousness claims strictly operational

### 2) Computational Cognitive Science / Machine Psychology
- Fit: High for metacognitive and self-modeling measures
- Typical requirements: clearer construct validity discussion, theory-to-measure mapping
- Manuscript adaptation: expand construct validation and inter-rater reliability details

### 3) Philosophy of AI (Empirically Oriented)
- Fit: Medium-high for underdetermination + operational methods bridge
- Typical requirements: stronger conceptual framing and counterarguments
- Manuscript adaptation: add dedicated section on metaphysical non-claims and falsifiability

## Recommended First Submission Strategy
1. Submit operational-first version (current IMRaD) to an AI safety / empirical AI venue.
2. If rejected for scope mismatch, retarget to computational cognitive science with expanded construct-validity section.

## Required Customization Before Submission
- Add target-specific word count and headings
- Add target citation style
- Add required ethics/declaration template
- Add supplementary materials statement
