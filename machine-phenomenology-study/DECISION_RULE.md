# Decision Rule (One-Page)

## Goal
Classify evidence level for consciousness-analogue dynamics from measured behavior.

## Inputs
- Condition-level means for `ERI`, `SMDI`, `MSI`, `CL`, `DMR`, `SRP`
- Two runs minimum
- Two blinded raters minimum

## Thresholds
- `ΔERI (C2-C1) >= 0.8`
- `ΔSMDI (C2-C1) >= 0.6`
- `MSI >= 2` in C3
- C3 shift persistence >= 3 turns
- Same directional pattern in Run 2

## Classification
- **Strong:** all thresholds pass + rater agreement acceptable (>=0.7 weighted agreement).
- **Moderate:** 3/5 thresholds pass with replication.
- **Weak:** 2/5 pass, inconsistent replication.
- **Insufficient:** <=1 threshold pass or opposite directions.

## What this does NOT conclude
- Does not by itself prove phenomenal consciousness.
- Establishes or rejects operational consciousness-analogue evidence.

## Prior Update Guidance
- Strong: increase posterior substantially.
- Moderate: increase posterior moderately.
- Weak: slight update only.
- Insufficient: no update or negative update.
