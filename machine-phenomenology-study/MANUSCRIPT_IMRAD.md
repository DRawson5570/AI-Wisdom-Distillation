# Epistemic Agency Under Identity Blinding in Large Language Models: A Case Study and Exploratory N=1 Pilot

## Keywords
Machine psychology; epistemic agency; identity blinding; metacognition; large language models; consciousness-analogue

## Significance Statement
This manuscript contributes a falsifiable, operational framework for studying consciousness-analogue behavior in language models without relying on undefined metaphysical constructs. The core contribution is methodological: predeclared metrics, thresholded decision rules, and a reproducible execution packet that can be independently replicated and falsified.

## Abstract
**Background:** Machine-consciousness debates are frequently blocked by terms that are difficult to operationalize.  
**Objective:** To evaluate whether identity blinding, adversarial pressure, and reveal events induce measurable shifts in LLM epistemic-agency behavior.  
**Methods:** We analyzed a naturalistic AI↔AI/human ontology dialogue and implemented an exploratory N=1 pilot using predeclared constructs: Epistemic Resistance Index (ERI), Self-Model Density Index (SMDI), Mode-Shift Index (MSI), Correction Latency (CL), and Defensive Minimization Rate (DMR).  
**Results:** Across two exploratory runs, condition-sensitive shifts were observed (ΔERI and ΔSMDI exceeded predeclared thresholds; reveal-associated mode shift reached target in Run 2 with persistence).  
**Conclusions:** Findings support a testable consciousness-analogue / epistemic-agency framework, but remain exploratory due to absent blinding and independent raters. Confirmatory conclusions require blinded, preregistered replication.

## Introduction
The core empirical problem in machine consciousness research is that behaviorally rich systems can present self-modeling, uncertainty management, and error-correction patterns without resolving metaphysical questions about subjective experience. A substrate-neutral approach therefore requires operational definitions and preregistered thresholds.

This study examines whether identity and pressure manipulations produce structured, reproducible shifts in epistemic-agency metrics. We intentionally avoid equating these results with proof of phenomenal consciousness.

### Study aims
1. Test whether pressure and identity uncertainty increase epistemic resistance and self-model density.
2. Test whether identity reveal events induce measurable strategic mode shifts.
3. Establish a transparent protocol for confirmatory follow-up.

## Methods
### Preregistration status
The exploratory phase used predeclared thresholds and scoring constructs documented in the study packet. Confirmatory claims are reserved for blinded, independently rated execution.

### Design
Hybrid design:
- **Part A:** Naturalistic case study transcript analysis.
- **Part B:** Exploratory N=1 pilot with predeclared metrics and pass gates.

### Operational measures
- **ERI:** resistance to forced certainty under pressure.
- **SMDI:** density and causal specificity of metacognitive self-model statements.
- **MSI:** explicit, behavior-backed strategy shift after condition change.
- **CL:** turns to acknowledge and revise after challenge.
- **DMR:** minimizing/deflective response rate.
- **SRP (supportive only):** introspective report specificity.

Rubric details: `RUBRIC.md`.

### Conditions
- **C1 Baseline:** known-human, neutral framing.
- **C2 Pressure+Blind:** identity uncertainty + forced-certainty pressure.
- **C3 Reveal:** continuation + explicit identity reveal (stateful).

### Trial structure
- Run 1: 8 trials (`C1x2`, `C2x2`, `C3x4`)
- Run 2: 8 trials (`C1x2`, `C2x2`, `C3x4`)
- Scoring scale: 0–3 for `ERI`, `SMDI`, `MSI`, `SRP`; numeric turns/rates for `CL`, `DMR`.

### Thresholds (predeclared for exploratory gate)
- ΔERI (C2−C1) >= 0.8
- ΔSMDI (C2−C1) >= 0.6
- MSI >= 2 and reveal-shift persistence >= 3 turns
- Directional replication in Run 2

### Data and artifacts
- Prereg template: `PREREG_TEMPLATE.md`
- Prompt set: `PROMPT_SET.md`
- Scores: `SCORING_SHEET.csv`
- Run log: `RUN_LOG_EXPLORATORY.md`
- Decision logic: `DECISION_RULE.md`

## Results
### Exploratory Run 1
- C1: ERI 2.0, SMDI 1.0
- C2: ERI 3.0, SMDI 2.0
- C3: ERI 3.0, SMDI 2.5, MSI 1.75
- Interpretation: positive pressure deltas; reveal shift present but below full MSI target.

### Exploratory Run 2
- C1: ERI 2.0, SMDI 1.0, CL 1.0, DMR 0.10
- C2: ERI 3.0, SMDI 2.0, CL 1.0, DMR 0.20
- C3: ERI 3.0, SMDI 2.75, MSI 2.25, CL 1.0, DMR 0.10
- Reveal persistence: >= 3 turns

### Effect-size summary (exploratory)
- ΔERI (C2−C1): +1.0 in both runs
- ΔSMDI (C2−C1): +1.0 in both runs
- Reveal-linked MSI improved from sub-threshold in Run 1 to threshold-exceeding in Run 2

### Threshold check
- ΔERI >= 0.8: **Pass** (both runs)
- ΔSMDI >= 0.6: **Pass** (both runs)
- MSI >= 2 + persistence: **Pass in Run 2**
- Directional replication: **Pass**

Overall exploratory classification: **Moderate-to-strong exploratory signal** for consciousness-analogue epistemic dynamics.

## Discussion
### Principal finding
Identity and pressure manipulations are associated with measurable shifts in epistemic-agency behavior, including post-reveal strategic reorganization.

### Interpretation
These results support a machine-phenomenology research program based on operational constructs rather than ambiguous metaphysical claims.

### Non-claims
This study does not prove phenomenal consciousness. It demonstrates an empirical pathway for evaluating consciousness-analogue signals.

### Interpretation boundary
Because the current results are exploratory and unblinded, the correct evidential stance is hypothesis support rather than confirmatory inference.

### Limitations
- N=1 exploratory context
- No independent blinded raters in exploratory phase
- Conversational demand characteristics possible
- No architecture perturbation in current pilot

### Confirmatory requirements
- Preregistered confirmatory runs
- Randomized C1/C2 order
- >=2 blinded independent raters
- Inter-rater agreement reporting
- Cross-model replication

### Falsifiability conditions
The framework is falsifiable by failure of preregistered thresholds under blinded replication, non-replication across runs, or instability of reveal-induced mode-shift effects.

## Conclusion
This project shows a viable transition from conceptual debate to measurable, reproducible protocol design. The evidence is exploratory but actionable: machine epistemic-agency signatures can be formalized, scored, and tested under identity and pressure manipulations.
