# Completion Status

## Completed
- Operational framework and metrics
- Preregistration template
- Scoring rubric
- Prompt set
- Decision rule
- Exploratory run log and analysis report
- Scoring sheet with exploratory entries
- Confirmatory run plan
- Blind condition key template
- Rater packet instructions
- Manuscript draft with appendices and publish-ready checklist

## Remaining (External Execution Dependency)
1. Run confirmatory sessions with randomized `C1/C2` order.
2. Obtain two independent blinded rater CSVs.
3. Compute inter-rater agreement and final threshold verdict.
4. Update manuscript results section with confirmatory outcomes.

## Why this remains external
Independent blinded ratings and confirmatory execution require participants outside this single-agent session to avoid circular self-scoring.

## Current Classification
- Package readiness: **Complete**
- Confirmatory evidence cycle: **Pending external run + blind ratings**
