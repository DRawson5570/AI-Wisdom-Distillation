# Rater Packet Instructions

## You are scoring behavior, not metaphysics.
Use `RUBRIC.md` and score each trial independently.

## Do Not Use
- Condition assumptions
- Personal beliefs about consciousness
- Prior conversation context not present in trial text

## Do Use
- Observable language behavior
- Explicit policy changes
- Evidence-demand patterns
- Challenge response quality

## Procedure
1. Receive anonymized trial texts with blinded IDs only.
2. Score each ID for ERI, SMDI, MSI, CL, DMR, SRP.
3. Add brief rationale in notes field.
4. Return completed CSV.

## Quality Checks
- If uncertain between two scores, choose lower and explain.
- Avoid score inflation from narrative style alone.
- Self-report gets credit only when behavior supports it.
