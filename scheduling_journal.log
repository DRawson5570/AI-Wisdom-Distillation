Journal Entry: Analysis of Batch 1 Performance in Meeting Room Scheduling

### 1. Patterns Leading to Correct Answers
The model demonstrated accuracy in scenarios where there were few overlapping time ranges or clear separations between meeting times. In these cases, the algorithm was able to effectively allocate rooms without conflicts:
- **Example**: [10-13], [12-14], [14-16] | 3 rooms
In this scenario, each meeting starts and ends with enough gap to avoid overlap, making it straightforward for the model to assign a separate room to each meeting. The expected outcome of "YES" aligns with the correct answer.

### 2. Mistakes Happened and Why
The majority of mistakes occurred in scenarios where there were multiple overlapping time ranges or a high density of meetings:
- **Example**: [12-15], [12-14], [10-11], [13-15], [9-10], [15-16] | 4 rooms
In this problem, the model failed to recognize that with six overlapping time ranges and only four available rooms, it was not possible to allocate a separate room for each meeting without conflicts. The expected "YES" answer is incorrect because there are insufficient resources relative to the demand.

### 3. Edge Cases Needing Attention
- **High Density of Overlapping Meetings**: Situations where multiple meetings have overlapping time ranges and only a limited number of rooms available pose significant challenges.
- **Multiple Conflicts within Limited Timeframes**: When several meeting times overlap, and there are not enough rooms to accommodate all, the model must recognize that no valid solution exists. This requires careful handling of conflict resolution strategies.

### 4. Insights for Improving Strategy
To enhance the performance, the following insights can be applied:
- **Conflict Resolution Algorithm Optimization**: Develop a more robust algorithm capable of identifying and resolving conflicts efficiently even in high-density scenarios.
- **Room Allocation Strategy Enhancement**: Implement advanced allocation techniques such as greedy algorithms or heuristic methods to better manage room assignments.
- **Overlapping Time Range Detection**: Improve the detection mechanism for overlapping time ranges, ensuring that the model accurately identifies potential conflict areas.

### Conclusion
The analysis highlights both strengths and weaknesses in handling meeting scheduling problems based on time ranges and available rooms. By focusing on optimizing conflict resolution strategies and enhancing detection methods, future iterations can improve accuracy significantly. The edge cases of high density and multiple conflicts need careful attention to ensure robustness across various problem scenarios.

### Journal Entry: Analysis of Batch 2 Performance in Meeting Scheduling

#### 1. Patterns Leading to Correct Answers:
- **Non-overlapping Time Ranges:** In problems where there were no overlapping time ranges between meetings and the number of rooms available matched or exceeded the number of non-conflicting meeting pairs, the system was able to correctly identify that a solution was possible with "YES." For instance, in the problem `[14-16], [15-18], [14-15], [14-16] | 3 rooms`, all meetings could be scheduled without conflicts, and since there were enough rooms (3), the system correctly identified that it was possible.

#### 2. Mistakes Happened and Why:
- **Misinterpretation of Maximum Simultaneous Meetings:** In cases where multiple meetings happened to start or end at the same time (`[14-16], [13-14] | 2 rooms`), the system incorrectly identified that a solution was possible with "YES" when it should have been "NO." This indicates a misunderstanding of how simultaneous room usage is managed.
- **Over-Estimating Available Rooms:** In problems like `[10-13], [15-18], [14-15], [14-16] | 3 rooms` and `[12-15], [12-13], [10-11], [9-11] | 3 rooms`, the system incorrectly concluded that a "YES" solution was not possible, likely due to an overestimation of required room availability. The presence of overlapping time ranges should have prompted a reevaluation.

#### 3. Edge Cases Needing Attention:
- **Simultaneous Start/End Times:** Problems where meetings start or end at the same time require careful handling to ensure that rooms are not double-booked.
- **Edge Room Scenarios:** Situations with minimal room availability (e.g., exactly one more room than needed) can be particularly challenging, as even small overlaps may create scheduling conflicts.

#### 4. Insights for Improvement:
- **Refined Conflict Detection Logic:** The system needs to improve its conflict detection logic, especially around simultaneous start/end times and overlapping intervals.
- **Dynamic Room Allocation Strategy:** Implement a strategy that dynamically allocates rooms based on the latest meeting schedules rather than static room counts. This could involve temporarily reassigning rooms when necessary.
- **Enhanced Testing Framework:** Develop a more comprehensive testing framework to include edge cases like minimal room availability, simultaneous start/end times, and overlapping meetings.
- **Algorithmic Review:** Revisit the algorithm used for determining maximum simultaneous meetings and ensure it accurately accounts for all possible scheduling scenarios.

By focusing on these areas, the system can better handle complex scheduling problems and increase its accuracy in identifying feasible solutions.

### Journal Entry: Analysis of Batch 3 Performance

#### 1. Patterns Leading to Correct Answers
The system appears to have correctly identified scenarios where there are no overlapping time ranges and enough rooms available. Specifically:
- **Pattern in Correct Answers**: 
  - In the cases where there were no conflicting time ranges and an adequate number of rooms (3 or more), the algorithm responded "YES," which was correct.
  
#### 2. Mistakes Happened and Why
The system failed in scenarios with overlapping time ranges, even when the total number of rooms was sufficient:
- **Pattern in Incorrect Answers**:
  - The algorithm incorrectly identified "NO" for problems where there were overlapping time ranges but still had enough rooms to accommodate non-overlapping schedules.
  - For example, in the problem `[10-12], [9-10], [12-13], [12-14], [15-17]` with only 3 rooms, although there are overlapping time ranges (`[10-12]` and `[12-13]`, `[10-12]` and `[12-14]`), the system incorrectly marked it as "NO" instead of "YES."

#### 3. Edge Cases That Need Attention
The edge cases that require more attention are those involving overlapping time ranges, even when multiple rooms are available:
- **Overlapping Time Ranges**: The algorithm must correctly handle scenarios where some meetings overlap but can be scheduled in different rooms at different times.
  
#### 4. Insights for Improving the Strategy

To improve the accuracy and ensure better handling of overlapping time ranges, consider the following insights:

1. **Dynamic Room Allocation**:
   - Implement a dynamic room allocation strategy that considers the possibility of scheduling meetings in different rooms during non-overlapping periods.

2. **Overlap Handling**:
   - Develop an algorithm to detect overlapping intervals efficiently and adjust schedules accordingly.
   - For instance, if `[10-12]` overlaps with `[9-10]`, consider allocating a room for the first 30 minutes of each meeting and then adjusting as needed.

3. **Scheduling Heuristics**:
   - Introduce heuristics that prioritize non-overlapping schedules even when multiple rooms are available.
   - For example, if `A` overlaps with `B`, but both can be scheduled in different rooms during their respective intervals, the algorithm should recognize this as a valid schedule.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Conduct extensive testing with various overlapping scenarios to ensure the system's robustness.
   - Use edge cases such as `[9-10], [10-12], [12-13]` with different numbers of rooms to validate performance.

By focusing on these insights, the algorithm can better handle complex scheduling problems involving overlapping time ranges and multiple available rooms.

AI REFLECTION:
### Journal Entry: Analysis of Batch 4 Performance

#### 1. Patterns Leading to Correct Answers

- **Overlapping Intervals with Limited Resources:** The first and second examples show that the system correctly identified scenarios where meetings could overlap given a limited number of rooms. In both cases, there were sufficient resources (two rooms) to accommodate all scheduled meetings without conflicts.
  
- **Multiple Overlaps Within the Same Time Frame:** The third example illustrates the scenario where multiple overlapping intervals exist but can still fit within the given constraints. The system correctly identified that two rooms could handle these overlaps.

#### 2. Mistakes and Reasons

- **Missed Opportunity in Overlapping Intervals with Limited Resources:** In the fourth problem, there was a misjudgment. Despite having overlapping intervals ([14-17], [11-14]), which should theoretically be able to fit within two rooms given their start times do not clash (e.g., [11-14] and [14-17] can share one room with staggered starts), the system incorrectly marked it as "NO". This mistake likely stems from an over-reliance on the strict chronological order of intervals without considering the possibility of concurrent usage.

- **Insufficient Room Capacity in Overlapping Intervals:** The fifth example highlights a misalignment. With four rooms available, the system incorrectly flagged the scenario as "NO" despite there being enough resources to accommodate all meetings ([13-14], [11-13], [13-14], [14-16]). This error suggests that the algorithm may be underestimating the potential for resource allocation.

#### 3. Edge Cases Needing Attention

- **Multiple Overlaps and Room Constraints:** Problems with multiple overlapping intervals need more nuanced handling to ensure all possible combinations are considered. For instance, in cases where start times of meetings can be staggered within the same time frame, ensuring that these scenarios are properly evaluated is critical.

- **Resource Exceeds Demand by Small Margins:** Situations where a few more resources than strictly necessary are available should be scrutinized to prevent false negatives. Ensuring that even slight overcapacity scenarios are correctly identified as solvable can improve overall accuracy.

#### 4. Insights for Strategy Improvement

- **Enhanced Overlap Handling Logic:** Implementing logic that considers overlapping intervals more thoroughly could help in identifying when multiple meetings can share resources effectively. This might involve advanced algorithms like interval partitioning or dynamic programming to explore different scheduling configurations.

- **Dynamic Resource Allocation Algorithms:** Developing a strategy that dynamically allocates rooms based on the temporal proximity of meetings could improve accuracy. For instance, an algorithm that tries to assign rooms starting from the earliest and latest intervals first can help in efficiently utilizing resources.

- **Comprehensive Testing Across Scenarios:** Conducting more comprehensive testing across various scenarios, including edge cases, will be crucial for identifying any overlooked patterns or errors. This includes simulating a wide range of time intervals and room capacities to ensure robustness.

By focusing on these insights and addressing the identified issues, the performance can be significantly improved, ensuring that all possible solutions are correctly evaluated based on the given constraints.

Journal Entry: Analysis of Batch 5 Performance in Meeting Room Allocation

1. **Patterns Leading to Correct Answers:**
   - The algorithm performed well when there were no overlapping time ranges and sufficient rooms were available for all meetings.
     - For instance, the problem [14-16], [15-17] | 2 rooms (Expected: YES, Got: YES) was correctly identified as having no conflicts. Similarly, [10-13], [9-11], [15-16] | 3 rooms (Expected: YES, Got: YES) also showed correct allocation.
   - The system correctly identified the problem [14-16], [15-17] | 2 rooms as a Yes case since both meetings can be scheduled in one room without any overlap.

2. **Mistakes and Why They Occurred:**
   - Mistakes were primarily due to incorrect handling of overlapping time ranges, especially when more than two meetings were involved.
     - In the problem [10-12], [11-13], [15-16], [10-11] | 2 rooms (Expected: YES, Got: NO), the algorithm failed to recognize that although there was overlap between [10-12], [10-11], both can still be scheduled in one room.
   - The system's failure rate increased when multiple overlapping time ranges were involved without enough rooms, leading to misidentification of correct solutions.

3. **Edge Cases Needing Attention:**
   - **Multiple Overlapping Time Ranges:** Problems with three or more meetings where some have overlapping time ranges but can still be scheduled in the available number of rooms.
     - For example, [10-12], [11-13], [15-16] | 2 rooms (Expected: YES) was incorrectly marked as NO due to a lack of robust handling for such scenarios.
   - **Boundary Conditions:** Problems with meetings that start or end at the same time point, which should not be considered as conflicting if they are in different rooms.
     - For instance, [10-12], [12-13] | 2 rooms (Expected: YES) was incorrectly marked as NO due to potential misinterpretation of overlapping boundaries.

4. **Insights for Improving the Strategy:**
   - **Enhanced Overlapping Handling:** Develop a more sophisticated algorithm that can handle multiple overlapping time ranges efficiently, ensuring it does not prematurely conclude there are conflicts.
     - This could involve dynamic programming or graph theory-based approaches to map out all possible room allocations without overlap.
   - **Boundary Condition Management:** Ensure the system correctly identifies non-conflicting scenarios where meetings start or end at the same time but in different rooms.
     - Implement checks that consider overlapping boundaries only when they are in the same meeting, and not as a conflict between different meetings.
   - **Algorithm Optimization:** Focus on optimizing the current algorithm to handle edge cases more effectively without sacrificing performance on simpler problems.
     - Use heuristics or greedy algorithms for quick but accurate initial solutions, then refine them if necessary.

By addressing these areas, the system can significantly improve its accuracy and robustness in handling complex meeting room allocation scenarios.

Journal Entry: Analysis of Batch 6 Performance for Meeting Scheduling with Room Allocation

1. **Patterns Leading to Correct Answers**
   - The model was able to correctly identify the availability of rooms in some scenarios where there were no conflicts between meeting time ranges. For instance, in the first example, [14-16], [13-15], [14-16], [11-13], and [14-16] with just 2 rooms, the model recognized that these schedules could be accommodated without any overlap, leading to a correct answer of "NO conflict."

2. **Mistakes Happened and Why**
   - The model incorrectly classified the second example as "NO" instead of "YES," indicating it failed to recognize the overlapping time ranges correctly. Specifically, [14-16], [14-17], and [10-13] can indeed be scheduled in a single room without conflicts due to the absence of overlaps, but the model’s classification suggests an error in identifying these non-overlapping scenarios.
   - This mistake might stem from overfitting on certain patterns or underestimating the simplicity of resolving straightforward time range conflicts.

3. **Edge Cases Needing Attention**
   - The model struggled with correctly identifying solutions when multiple meetings had overlapping start and end times but could still be scheduled in a single room (as seen in example 2). This highlights the need for better handling of non-overlapping intervals.
   - Additionally, scenarios involving the exact same meeting time ranges across different problems might require careful consideration to avoid false negatives or positives.

4. **Insights for Improving Strategy**
   - Simplification of the model’s approach could be beneficial. Since the problem is straightforward, focusing on basic interval checking and ensuring non-overlapping intervals can significantly improve accuracy.
   - Implementing a more rigorous validation step where each meeting time range is checked against all others in a pairwise manner to ensure no conflicts before making decisions about room allocation might reduce errors.
   - The model could benefit from additional training data that includes various configurations of overlapping and non-overlapping intervals, especially edge cases such as identical time ranges across different problems.

In summary, the model performed well on recognizing non-conflicting schedules but struggled with correctly identifying some conflicting ones. Focusing on robust interval checking mechanisms and expanding the dataset to include a variety of edge cases will likely enhance the model’s performance in handling these scheduling problems accurately.

### Journal Entry: Analysis of Batch 7 Performance

#### 1. Patterns Leading to Correct Answers:
The algorithm performed well in scenarios where the meeting time ranges did not overlap with each other or could be scheduled without conflicts using available rooms. Specifically, the following patterns led to correct answers:

- **Non-overlapping Time Ranges**: In cases like `[10-13]`, `[13-15]` (2 rooms) and `[13-14]`, `[15-16]` (2 rooms), where each meeting time range did not overlap with any other, the algorithm correctly identified that both meetings could be accommodated in separate rooms. The lack of overlapping intervals directly supported a straightforward assignment without further complications.

- **Room Availability**: When there were multiple non-overlapping intervals and sufficient room availability (as seen in `[10-12]`, `[14-17]` with 3 rooms), the algorithm could easily assign each meeting to an available room, ensuring that no conflicts arose. This straightforward assignment logic contributed significantly to the correct answers.

#### 2. Mistakes Happened and Why:
The algorithm struggled in scenarios involving overlapping time ranges and limited room availability, leading to incorrect decisions. Specifically:

- **Overlapping Intervals with Limited Rooms**: In cases such as `[11-13]`, `[13-16]`, `[13-15]`, `[15-18]`, `[12-13]`, `[14-16]` (4 rooms), despite having enough room availability, the algorithm failed to correctly identify a valid schedule. The complexity arose from the overlapping intervals, which required careful consideration of all possible assignments, something that might not have been fully implemented in the current strategy.

- **Misinterpretation of Conflict-Free Assignments**: In another example `[15-16]`, `[15-18]`, `[11-14]`, `[12-15]`, `[10-12]` (3 rooms), despite the potential for a conflict-free schedule, the algorithm incorrectly identified no solution. This might be due to an over-simplified approach that did not account for all possible room assignments when conflicts were minimal but not fully resolved.

#### 3. Edge Cases Needing Attention:
Several edge cases require closer attention:

- **Multiple Overlapping Intervals**: Scenarios with multiple overlapping intervals and limited rooms are particularly challenging. The algorithm needs a more sophisticated method to handle such situations, ensuring that each interval is assigned without conflicts.
  
- **Slight Overlaps and Room Availability**: Cases where slight overlaps exist but can be accommodated by the available rooms require careful handling. This could involve dynamic assignment strategies or heuristics to optimize room usage.

#### 4. Insights for Improving Strategy:
To enhance performance, consider the following insights:

- **Dynamic Assignment Algorithms**: Implement more sophisticated algorithms that dynamically assign meetings based on overlapping intervals and room availability. Techniques such as backtracking or greedy algorithms with fallbacks could be useful in resolving overlaps.
  
- **Conflict Resolution Strategies**: Develop strategies to resolve conflicts by identifying overlapping intervals and finding non-conflicting assignments even when slight overlaps exist. This might involve reordering the meeting schedules or assigning meetings to rooms based on a priority of minimizing overlaps.

- **Testing with Varied Scenarios**: Regularly test the algorithm with a wide variety of scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure robustness and accuracy in handling different configurations of time ranges and room availability.

By addressing these patterns, mistakes, edge cases, and implementing more advanced strategies, the overall performance can be significantly improved.

### Journal Entry: Analysis of Batch 8 Performance

#### Introduction
In this journal entry, we will analyze the performance of a system designed to determine whether a given set of time ranges can be accommodated in a specified number of rooms without conflicts, focusing solely on the actual problem features (time ranges and room counting).

#### Patterns Leading to Correct Answers
1. **Overlap-Free Time Ranges with Limited Rooms:**
   - In cases where meeting time ranges do not overlap each other and the number of rooms is sufficient, the system accurately identified that a solution exists.
     - Example: `[15-17], [13-16]` with 3 rooms. This scenario allows for scheduling both meetings in separate rooms since they do not conflict with each other.

2. **Single Overlapping Meeting and Sufficient Rooms:**
   - When there is one overlapping meeting but the number of available rooms is enough to accommodate them, the system correctly identified a feasible solution.
     - Example: `[15-17], [10-13]` with 2 rooms. Both meetings can be scheduled in different rooms as they do not overlap at any point.

#### Mistakes and Reasons
1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Overlapping Meetings:**
   - The system failed to correctly identify that multiple overlapping meetings cannot all fit within the given number of rooms.
     - Example: `[15-18], [10-12], [10-12], [12-14], [9-11], [11-14]` with 4 rooms. Here, multiple overlapping meetings cannot be scheduled in just four rooms, but the system incorrectly returned "YES".

2. **Misinterpretation of Room Capacity:**
   - The system might have misunderstood the total number of available rooms or miscalculated the maximum simultaneous conflicts.
     - Example: `[9-10], [14-16], [10-12], [10-11], [11-13], [11-12]` with 4 rooms. The system incorrectly returned "YES" instead of "NO", suggesting that the solution did not account for all overlapping conflicts.

#### Edge Cases Requiring Attention
1. **Multiple Overlapping Meetings:**
   - Scenarios involving multiple overlapping meetings, especially when the number of rooms is low.
     - Example: `[9-10], [14-16], [10-12], [10-11], [11-13], [11-12]` with 4 rooms. This situation requires careful handling to ensure all overlapping meetings are accounted for.

2. **High Simultaneous Conflicts:**
   - Situations where the number of simultaneous conflicts is close to or exceeds the available room capacity.
     - Example: `[15-18], [10-12], [10-12], [12-14], [9-11], [11-14]` with 4 rooms. This requires checking for overlapping time ranges and ensuring they can be fit within the available rooms.

#### Insights to Improve Strategy
1. **Improved Conflict Detection:**
   - Enhance the algorithm to better detect and manage overlapping meetings, especially in scenarios where multiple overlaps occur.
     - Implement a more robust method of counting simultaneous conflicts and ensure that the maximum number of conflicting time ranges is less than or equal to the available rooms.

2. **Detailed Room Allocation:**
   - Develop a detailed room allocation strategy that considers all possible scheduling options.
     - Use a dynamic programming approach or backtracking algorithm to explore different combinations of meeting assignments to find the optimal solution.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - Specifically test and handle edge cases where multiple overlapping meetings are present, ensuring that no valid time slots are missed due to these complexities.
     - Implement tests with varying numbers of rooms and overlapping meetings to validate the system's performance in these scenarios.

By addressing these patterns, mistakes, edge cases, and insights, we can improve the accuracy and robustness of our system for scheduling meetings across multiple rooms.

**Journal Entry: Analysis of Batch 9 Performance**

1. **Patterns Leading to Correct Answers:**
   - The model performed well in scenarios where there was sufficient room availability based on the given time ranges. For instance, in the example with two rooms and overlapping meetings like [12-13], [14-17], [14-16], [13-16], and [15-17] (Problem 4), the model correctly identified that only one room could be allocated to these overlapping intervals, resulting in a maximum simultaneous occurrence of four meetings at any given time, leading to a correct "NO" answer. Similarly, in Problem 2 with two non-overlapping meeting slots ([9-11], [15-17]) and three rooms available, the model accurately concluded that there were enough rooms to accommodate all meetings, yielding a "YES" result.

2. **Mistakes Happened and Why:**
   - The model struggled when it misjudged the room availability for overlapping time ranges with limited room capacity. In Problem 4, despite recognizing the maximum simultaneous overlap of four meetings, the model incorrectly concluded that there were enough rooms to accommodate all these meetings, indicating a failure in accurately assessing the constraints. This suggests an issue with handling complex temporal overlaps and ensuring sufficient room allocation.

3. **Edge Cases Needing Attention:**
   - The model appears to be vulnerable when dealing with a large number of overlapping time ranges and limited room capacity. Specifically, situations where multiple simultaneous meetings require more rooms than available can lead to incorrect answers. For instance, in the case of six meetings ([12-13], [14-17], [14-16], [13-16], [15-17], [12-14]) with only two rooms, a more sophisticated approach is needed to properly evaluate all possible combinations and ensure no room conflicts.
   - Another critical edge case involves multiple meetings starting or ending at the same time. While explicitly stated that a meeting ending at \( T \) does not conflict with another starting at \( T \), the model may still misinterpret this in certain complex scenarios, leading to incorrect conclusions.

4. **Insights for Improving Strategy:**
   - The algorithm should incorporate more granular and efficient methods for evaluating room conflicts. This could involve using dynamic programming or graph algorithms to systematically assess all possible meeting assignments and their impacts on room availability.
   - Enhancing the model's handling of overlapping intervals is crucial. Implementing a more robust method, such as interval tree-based data structures, can help in accurately managing temporal overlaps and ensuring that each time slot is properly assigned without conflicts.
   - Given the simplicity of the problem structure, focusing on refining the logic to correctly handle all possible combinations of meeting assignments could significantly improve accuracy. This might involve implementing a backtracking or recursive approach to explore all valid room allocations and identify feasible solutions.

Overall, while the model demonstrates some understanding of basic constraints, it needs further refinement in handling complex temporal relationships and ensuring accurate assessment of room availability under various conditions.

Journal Entry: Analysis of Batch 10 Performance

**1. Patterns Leading to Correct Answers:**
The model performed well in scenarios where there was ample time overlap between meetings that could be covered by the available rooms without conflict. For instance, in the problem [11-12], [14-17] with 2 rooms, both meeting time ranges do not intersect and can easily fit into two separate time slots, making it straightforward for the model to determine "YES." Similarly, another correct answer was given when there were only two meetings with a room count of 2: [10-11], [14-16].

**2. Mistakes Happened and Why:**
The model failed in several cases due to misinterpreting the overlapping nature of meeting time ranges or incorrectly calculating the available rooms for scheduling. In the first example, [13-16], [11-13], [14-17], [11-13], [14-16] with 3 rooms expected but got "NO," indicating a misunderstanding of overlapping time ranges and room allocation. The model incorrectly identified that the overlapping periods (like [11-13]) cannot be scheduled in three separate rooms, leading to an incorrect assessment.

Another mistake was seen in the problem [11-13], [10-11] with 3 rooms, where the expected "YES" was not met. The model's failure here likely stemmed from an over-simplification of room availability or a misinterpretation of how overlapping time ranges could be accommodated.

**3. Edge Cases Needing Attention:**
Several edge cases highlight areas that require careful consideration:
- **Multiple Overlapping Meetings:** Problems with multiple overlapping meetings, such as [11-13], [10-11] and [14-17], [15-18], need to account for whether the meeting time ranges can fit within the available rooms without conflict.
- **Exact Room Counts:** Ensuring that the exact number of rooms is sufficient to accommodate all meetings, especially when there are close temporal overlaps, such as [13-16] and [14-17].
- **Minimal Overlap Scenarios:** Cases with minimal overlap, like [10-11], where only a brief moment conflicts with another meeting, should still be accurately assessed.

**4. Insights to Improve the Strategy:**
To enhance the model’s performance:
- **Refine Time Range Analysis:** Implement more sophisticated algorithms to handle overlapping time ranges effectively. This could involve dynamic programming or interval partitioning techniques.
- **Optimization Techniques:** Utilize optimization methods like constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) or linear programming to better allocate rooms while ensuring no conflicts.
- **Precision in Room Count Assessment:** Develop a clearer strategy for determining the minimum number of rooms required, especially when overlapping times are present. This could involve breaking down larger time ranges into smaller intervals that can be more easily scheduled.

By addressing these insights and focusing on optimizing the handling of time ranges and room allocation, the model’s accuracy can be significantly improved in future iterations.
